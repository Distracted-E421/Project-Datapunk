# Registry Synchronization Component

## Purpose

Provides eventual consistency across distributed service registries through state-based synchronization, conflict resolution, and efficient data transfer mechanisms.

## Context

The sync component ensures service information remains consistent across multiple registry instances while minimizing network overhead. It is critical for maintaining a coherent view of the service mesh across distributed deployments.

## Dependencies

- asyncio
- aiohttp
- ServiceRegistry (internal)
- MetricsCollector (internal)
- hashlib
- zlib

## Core Components
