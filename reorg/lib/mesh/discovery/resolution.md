# Service Resolution Component

## Purpose

Provides intelligent service instance selection with multiple resolution strategies, caching, and health-aware routing for the Datapunk service mesh.

## Context

The resolver works with the service registry to implement higher-level routing policies that support reliable service communication. It handles instance selection, load balancing, and failover scenarios.

## Dependencies

- asyncio
- ServiceRegistry (internal)
- LoadBalancer (internal)
- MetricsCollector (internal)

## Core Components

### ResolutionStrategy

Enum defining resolution approaches:

- DIRECT: Lowest latency, no guarantees
- LOAD_BALANCED: Even distribution
- NEAREST: Network locality
- FAILOVER: High availability
- WEIGHTED: Traffic shaping

### ResolutionConfig

Configuration dataclass for resolver behavior:

- Strategy selection
- Cache settings
- Health filtering
- Failover parameters
- Region preferences

### ServiceResolver

Main resolver class implementing:

- Strategy-based resolution
- Cache management
- Health filtering
- Load balancer integration
- Metrics collection

## Key Features

### Resolution Strategies

1. Direct Resolution

   - Fast path for simple cases
   - No balancing or failover
   - Lowest latency option

2. Load Balanced Resolution

   - Even traffic distribution
   - Multiple balancing algorithms
   - Health-aware selection

3. Nearest Instance Resolution

   - Network locality optimization
   - Region-aware selection
   - Configurable preferences

4. Failover Resolution

   - High availability focus
   - Automatic backup selection
   - Failure threshold tracking

5. Weighted Resolution
   - Controlled traffic distribution
   - Support for gradual rollout
   - A/B testing capability

### Caching System

- Resolution result caching
- Configurable TTLs
- Background refresh
- Cache consistency
- Memory optimization

### Health Awareness

- Health status filtering
- Automatic unhealthy instance exclusion
- Recovery detection
- Health check integration

## Performance Considerations

- Cache hit rates impact
- Resolution strategy overhead
- Memory usage with service scale
- Background refresh impact
- Health check frequency

## Security Considerations

- Instance selection validation
- Cache entry verification
- Health status trust
- Region boundary controls
- Metric collection privacy

## Known Issues

- Cache memory usage at scale
- Weighted distribution bias
- Region boundary effects
- Health status lag
- Strategy switching overhead

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Resolution Strategy Selection

   - Multiple strategies for different needs
   - Strategy-specific optimizations
   - Configurable defaults

2. Caching Approach

   - Performance vs freshness
   - Memory vs network usage
   - Background refresh overhead

3. Health Integration

   - Active vs passive health checks
   - Health status propagation
   - Recovery detection timing

4. Region Awareness
   - Local vs global optimization
   - Region preference flexibility
   - Cross-region failover

## Future Improvements

- Capability-based routing support
- Adaptive cache TTLs based on stability
- Improved weighted distribution for large instance counts
- Enhanced region-aware routing
- Dynamic strategy selection
