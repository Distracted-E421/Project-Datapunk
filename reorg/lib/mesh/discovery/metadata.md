# Service Metadata Management Component

## Purpose

Manages service metadata with efficient querying, caching, and indexing capabilities for the Datapunk service mesh.

## Context

The metadata manager is responsible for maintaining and querying service metadata across the mesh, enabling efficient service discovery based on metadata attributes like tags, versions, environments, and regions.

## Dependencies

- structlog
- CacheClient (internal)
- ServiceRegistration (internal)
- ServiceMetadata (internal)

## Core Components

### MetadataConfig

Configuration dataclass for metadata management:

- Cache settings and TTLs
- Validation rules
- Tag limits and constraints
- Query optimization settings

### MetadataIndex

Index structure maintaining:

- Tag-based indexes
- Version mappings
- Environment groupings
- Region assignments
- Last update timestamps

### MetadataManager

Main manager class implementing:

- Metadata CRUD operations
- Query optimization
- Cache management
- Validation rules
- Change tracking

## Key Features

### Metadata Management

- Full CRUD operations for service metadata
- Validation of metadata fields and values
- Automatic index updates
- Change tracking and timestamps

### Indexing Strategy

- Multi-dimensional indexing:
  - Tag-based lookup
  - Version tracking
  - Environment grouping
  - Region-based access
- Optimized query paths
- Automatic index maintenance

### Query Capabilities

- Multi-criteria filtering
- Tag-based searches
- Version filtering
- Environment selection
- Region-based queries

### Caching

- Distributed cache integration
- Configurable TTLs
- Automatic cache invalidation
- Cache consistency management

## Performance Considerations

- Index maintenance overhead
- Memory usage for large tag sets
- Query performance vs index complexity
- Cache hit rates impact
- Validation overhead

## Security Considerations

- Metadata validation rules
- Tag length and count limits
- Input sanitization
- Access control integration

## Known Issues

- Memory usage scales with tag count
- Index updates may impact write performance
- Cache coherency in distributed setups
- Query performance with complex filters

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Index vs Query Performance

   - Maintains multiple indexes for query speed
   - Accepts write overhead for query performance
   - Configurable index granularity

2. Validation vs Flexibility

   - Enforces metadata constraints
   - Provides configuration options
   - Balances safety and usability

3. Cache vs Consistency

   - Uses distributed caching for scale
   - Implements TTL-based invalidation
   - Accepts eventual consistency model

4. Memory vs Performance
   - Indexes optimize query paths
   - Memory usage grows with metadata
   - Configurable limits and constraints
