# Service Registry Component

## Purpose

Provides a distributed service registry that enables dynamic service discovery, registration, health monitoring, and state management for the Datapunk service mesh.

## Context

The service registry is a core component of the mesh architecture, maintaining the service topology and enabling reliable communication between components. It supports the mesh's service discovery, health monitoring, and event-driven architecture.

## Dependencies

- asyncio
- aiohttp
- structlog
- HealthCheck (internal)
- MetricsCollector (internal)

## Core Components

### ServiceStatus

Enum defining service lifecycle states:

- STARTING: Initial registration
- RUNNING: Healthy and accepting requests
- STOPPING: Graceful shutdown
- STOPPED: No longer accepting requests
- UNHEALTHY: Failed health checks
- UNKNOWN: State cannot be determined

### ServiceMetadata

Extended service information dataclass:

- Version tracking
- Environment designation
- Region information
- Custom tags
- Capability definitions
- Dependency tracking
- Endpoint mapping

### ServiceRegistration

Service instance registration record containing:

- Instance identity
- Service metadata
- Health status
- Load balancing configuration
- Registration timestamps

### ServiceRegistry

Main registry class implementing:

- Service inventory management
- Health monitoring
- Event notifications
- State persistence
- Multi-node synchronization

## Key Features

### Service Management

- Dynamic registration/deregistration
- Health status tracking
- Metadata management
- Load balancer integration
- Event-driven updates

### Health Monitoring

- Active health checks
- Configurable check intervals
- Automatic status updates
- Failure detection
- Recovery tracking

### State Management

- Persistent state storage
- State recovery
- Consistency maintenance
- Event history

### Event System

- Subscription-based notifications
- Event filtering
- Asynchronous delivery
- Error handling

## Performance Considerations

- Registry operation latency
- Event delivery overhead
- State persistence impact
- Memory usage with service scale
- Health check frequency balance

## Security Considerations

- Service authentication
- Health check endpoint security
- Event system access control
- State persistence encryption
- Input validation

## Known Issues

- Cleanup performance at scale
- Event delivery under high load
- State persistence overhead
- Health check timing accuracy
- Memory usage with large service counts

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. State Management

   - Persistent storage for recovery
   - Event-driven updates for consistency
   - Configurable persistence options

2. Health Monitoring

   - Active health checks for accuracy
   - Resource usage vs check frequency
   - Configurable check intervals

3. Event System

   - Asynchronous delivery for scale
   - At-least-once delivery semantics
   - Error handling vs performance

4. Consistency Model
   - Eventually consistent updates
   - Real-time health status
   - Configurable sync intervals

## Future Improvements

- Cluster synchronization for multi-node deployments
- Service versioning and gradual rollout support
- Improved cleanup performance for large service counts
- Enhanced event batching and delivery optimization
- Advanced health check strategies
