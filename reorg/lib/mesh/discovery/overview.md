# Service Discovery Module Overview

## Purpose

The discovery module provides a comprehensive service discovery and registry system for the Datapunk service mesh, enabling dynamic service location, health monitoring, and distributed state management.

## Context

This module is a critical component of the service mesh architecture, facilitating service-to-service communication, load balancing, and health monitoring. It supports the mesh's distributed nature while maintaining consistency and reliability.

## Module Components

### 1. DNS Resolver (`dns_resolver.py`)

- DNS-based service discovery
- Multi-level caching
- Failover support
- IPv4/IPv6 handling
- Health monitoring integration

### 2. Metadata Management (`metadata.py`)

- Service metadata tracking
- Multi-dimensional indexing
- Query optimization
- Validation rules
- Cache management

### 3. Service Registry (`registry.py`)

- Service registration/deregistration
- Health status tracking
- Event notifications
- State persistence
- Multi-node synchronization

### 4. Service Resolution (`resolution.py`)

- Multiple resolution strategies
- Load balancing integration
- Health-aware routing
- Caching system
- Region-aware selection

### 5. Registry Synchronization (`sync.py`)

- State-based synchronization
- Conflict resolution
- Network optimization
- Peer management
- Metrics collection

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow

1. Services register with Registry
2. Metadata is indexed and cached
3. DNS Resolver provides service lookup
4. Resolution strategies select instances
5. Sync maintains distributed consistency
