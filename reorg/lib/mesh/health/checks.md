# Health Check Implementation (checks.py)

## Purpose

Provides comprehensive health monitoring with system resource monitoring, service dependency checking, custom health check support, threshold-based status determination, and metrics collection.

## Core Components

### HealthStatus Enum

Service health states with routing implications:

- HEALTHY: Full service capability
- DEGRADED: Limited but functional
- UNHEALTHY: Service failure
- UNKNOWN: Status undetermined

### HealthCheckConfig

Configuration for health check behavior:

- check_interval: Time between checks (default: 15.0s)
- timeout: Individual check timeout (default: 5.0s)
- failure_threshold: Failures before marking unhealthy (default: 3)
- success_threshold: Successes before marking healthy (default: 2)
- System resource thresholds (CPU, memory, disk)
- Dependency check configuration

### HealthCheck Class

Main health monitoring manager implementing:

- Health check execution
- Check history tracking
- Status threshold management
- Metric reporting
- Dependency monitoring

## Key Features

1. System Resource Monitoring

   - CPU utilization tracking
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Disk space monitoring
   - Threshold-based status determination

2. Health Check Management

   - Async check execution
   - Success/failure tracking
   - Status thresholds
   - Check registration/unregistration

3. Dependency Checking

   - Service dependency verification
   - Timeout handling
   - Health status propagation
   - Failure detection

4. Metric Collection
   - Check execution metrics
   - Status transitions
   - Resource utilization
   - Error tracking

## Implementation Details

### Check Execution

```python
async def check_health(self) -> bool:
    results = await self._run_all_checks()
    return all(r.get("status") == HealthStatus.HEALTHY for r in results.values())
```

- Executes all registered checks
- Aggregates results
- Determines overall health
- Updates metrics

### Status Management

- Uses threshold-based approach
- Prevents status flapping
- Handles transient failures
- Maintains status stability

### Resource Monitoring

- Active CPU monitoring
- Memory utilization tracking
- Disk space verification
- Threshold evaluation

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient check scheduling
- Resource usage optimization
- Minimal monitoring overhead
- Configurable check intervals

## Security Considerations

- Protected check registration
- Validated configurations
- Resource limits
- Safe dependency checking

## Known Issues

None documented

## Future Improvements

1. Add network health monitoring
2. Implement predictive health analysis
3. Improve resource usage during intensive checks
4. Add custom check-specific thresholds
