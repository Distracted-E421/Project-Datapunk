# Health-Aware Load Balancing Strategies (health_aware_strategies.py)

## Purpose

Provides load balancing algorithms that consider instance health scores, historical performance, recovery patterns, and load distribution to enable intelligent traffic distribution while maintaining service reliability.

## Core Components

### HealthStrategyConfig

Configuration for health-aware strategies:

- min_health_score: Minimum for routing (default: 0.5)
- health_weight: Health score importance (default: 0.7)
- load_weight: Load balance importance (default: 0.3)
- recovery_threshold: Score for full recovery (default: 0.8)
- max_consecutive_failures: Failures before exclusion (default: 3)

### Strategy Implementations

1. HealthWeightedRoundRobin

   - Round-robin with health weighting
   - Even load distribution
   - Health consideration
   - Predictable behavior

2. HealthAwareLeastConnections

   - Connection-based selection
   - Health weighting
   - Load balancing
   - Resource optimization

3. AdaptiveHealthAware
   - Dynamic strategy selection
   - Health trend analysis
   - Failure pattern detection
   - Recovery preference

## Key Features

1. Health Integration

   - Score-based selection
   - Threshold enforcement
   - Weight application
   - Status consideration

2. Load Distribution

   - Even traffic spread
   - Resource awareness
   - Connection limits
   - Priority handling

3. Recovery Support

   - Progressive recovery
   - Health improvement
   - Failure tracking
   - Pattern detection

4. Metric Collection
   - Selection tracking
   - Health monitoring
   - Performance impact
   - Pattern analysis

## Implementation Details

### Health-Weighted Round Robin

```python
def select_instance(
    self,
    service: str,
    instances: List[ServiceInstance]
) -> Optional[ServiceInstance]:
```

Selection Process:

1. Filter by minimum health
2. Apply round-robin
3. Consider health scores
4. Record metrics

### Adaptive Strategy

```python
def select_instance(
    self,
    service: str,
    instances: List[ServiceInstance]
) -> Optional[ServiceInstance]:
```

Selection Phases:

1. Update health trends
2. Filter viable instances
3. Prefer recovering instances
4. Fall back to healthiest

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient instance selection
- Optimized health tracking
- Minimal overhead
- Resource awareness

## Security Considerations

- Protected selection process
- Validated health scores
- Safe state transitions
- Resource limits

## Known Issues

1. Weight calculation complexity
2. Trend analysis performance
3. Recovery timing sensitivity

## Future Improvements

1. Add machine learning-based strategy
2. Implement predictive health scoring
3. Optimize strategy switching
4. Enhance trend analysis
5. Improve recovery detection
