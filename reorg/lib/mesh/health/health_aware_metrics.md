# Health-Aware Metrics Collection (health_aware_metrics.py)

## Purpose

Provides comprehensive metrics collection for instance and service health tracking, load balancing decisions, circuit breaker states, recovery monitoring, and performance impact analysis.

## Core Components

### HealthAwareMetrics Class

Primary metrics collector implementing:

- Health score tracking
- Selection monitoring
- Recovery tracking
- Circuit breaker monitoring
- Performance metrics

## Key Features

1. Health Score Metrics

   - Instance health tracking
   - Service health aggregation
   - Score distribution
   - Trend monitoring

2. Selection Metrics

   - Health-based selections
   - Rejection tracking
   - Strategy effectiveness
   - Load distribution

3. Recovery Metrics

   - Recovery attempts
   - Success rates
   - Duration tracking
   - Pattern analysis

4. Circuit Breaker Metrics
   - State transitions
   - Break frequency
   - Recovery timing
   - Failure patterns

## Implementation Details

### Metric Categories

1. Health Scores

   ```python
   instance_health = Gauge(
       'load_balancer_instance_health_score',
       'Current health score of service instance',
       ['service', 'instance']
   )
   ```

2. Selection Tracking

   ```python
   health_based_selections = Counter(
       'load_balancer_health_based_selections_total',
       'Number of health-based instance selections',
       ['service', 'strategy', 'health_range']
   )
   ```

3. Recovery Monitoring

   ```python
   recovery_attempts = Counter(
       'load_balancer_recovery_attempts_total',
       'Number of instance recovery attempts',
       ['service', 'instance']
   )
   ```

4. Performance Impact
   ```python
   balancing_latency = Histogram(
       'load_balancer_selection_latency_seconds',
       'Time taken to select instance',
       ['service', 'strategy']
   )
   ```

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient metric collection
- Label cardinality management
- Memory optimization
- Collection frequency

## Security Considerations

- Protected metric access
- Validated updates
- Resource limits
- Data isolation

## Known Issues

1. High cardinality concerns
2. Metric cleanup needed
3. Label optimization required

## Future Improvements

1. Add metric aggregation by region
2. Implement metric retention policies
3. Optimize label cardinality
4. Add metric cleanup for removed instances
5. Improve data retention strategies
