# Health Check Aggregator (health_aggregator.py)

## Purpose

Aggregates health check results across service components, providing a unified view of service health status for mesh routing decisions and service discovery.

## Core Components

### HealthAggregator Class

Primary aggregator implementing:

- Check registry management
- Concurrent check execution
- Result caching
- Overall status determination

## Key Features

1. Health Check Management

   - Check registration/deregistration
   - Atomic check execution
   - Result caching
   - Status aggregation

2. Cache Management

   - TTL-based caching
   - Cache invalidation
   - Memory optimization
   - Cache consistency

3. Status Determination

   - Multi-check aggregation
   - Status degradation rules
   - Recovery detection
   - Health score calculation

4. Error Handling
   - Check failure isolation
   - Error context preservation
   - Retry prevention
   - Failure reporting

## Implementation Details

### Check Registration

```python
def add_check(self, name: str, check: BaseHealthCheck) -> None:
    """Register a new health check."""
    self.checks[name] = check
```

- Validates check uniqueness
- Initializes tracking
- Sets up monitoring
- Configures caching

### Health Aggregation

```python
async def check_health(self, use_cache: bool = True) -> Dict:
```

Process:

1. Use cache when valid
2. Run new checks concurrently
3. Determine overall status
4. Update cache

Status Rules:

- UNHEALTHY if any check is unhealthy
- DEGRADED if any check is degraded
- HEALTHY if all checks are healthy

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient cache utilization
- Optimized check execution
- Minimal coordination overhead
- Memory-aware caching

## Security Considerations

- Protected check registration
- Validated results
- Safe cache access
- Resource protection

## Known Issues

1. Components must be initialized in correct order
2. Cache memory usage could be improved
3. Dependency validation needs enhancement

## Future Improvements

1. Add weighted health scoring
2. Implement health trend analysis
3. Improve cache memory usage
4. Add support for check priorities
5. Enhance error handling
