# Health Check Types (health_check_types.py)

## Purpose

Defines foundational types for health monitoring including health status definitions, check result structures, base check interfaces, and common check implementations.

## Core Components

### HealthStatus Enum

Service health status levels:

- HEALTHY: Full service capability
- DEGRADED: Limited functionality
- UNHEALTHY: Service failure

### HealthCheckResult

Standardized result structure:

- Status reporting
- Failure context
- Timing information
- Extended metrics

### BaseHealthCheck

Abstract base for health checks:

- Async execution
- Standard result format
- Error handling
- Timeout behavior

## Implementations

### DatabaseHealthCheck

Database connectivity verification:

- Connection status
- Query execution
- Timeout handling
- Pool monitoring

### ResourceHealthCheck

System resource monitoring:

- CPU usage tracking
- Memory consumption
- Disk utilization
- Threshold management

### DependencyHealthCheck

External dependency monitoring:

- HTTP/HTTPS checks
- Status mapping
- Header support
- Timeout handling

## Key Features

1. Status Management

   - Clear state definitions
   - Status transitions
   - Alert triggering
   - Metric categorization

2. Result Standardization

   - Consistent reporting
   - Detailed context
   - Timing tracking
   - Metric collection

3. Check Framework

   - Common interface
   - Error handling
   - Timeout support
   - Resource management

4. Implementation Support
   - Base patterns
   - Common utilities
   - Reusable components
   - Extension points

## Implementation Details

### Health Status Mapping

```python
class HealthStatus(Enum):
    HEALTHY = "healthy"    # Full service capability
    DEGRADED = "degraded"  # Limited functionality
    UNHEALTHY = "unhealthy"  # Service failure
```

### Result Structure

```python
@dataclass
class HealthCheckResult:
    status: HealthStatus
    message: str
    details: Optional[Dict] = None
    timestamp: datetime = datetime.utcnow()
```

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient status tracking
- Optimized result handling
- Minimal overhead
- Resource awareness

## Security Considerations

- Protected status changes
- Validated results
- Safe error handling
- Resource limits

## Known Issues

None documented

## Future Improvements

1. Add health score calculation
2. Implement check aggregation
3. Improve error detail standardization
4. Add check cancellation support
5. Enhance timeout handling
