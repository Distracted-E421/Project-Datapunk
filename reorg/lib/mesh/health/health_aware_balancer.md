# Health-Aware Load Balancer (health_aware_balancer.py)

## Purpose

Provides intelligent load balancing with health-based instance selection, circuit breaking for fault isolation, gradual recovery mechanisms, health score tracking, and continuous health monitoring.

## Core Components

### HealthAwareConfig

Configuration for health-aware load balancing:

- check_interval: Health check frequency (default: 30.0s)
- health_threshold: Minimum score for routing (default: 0.5)
- recovery_threshold: Score needed for circuit recovery (default: 0.8)
- circuit_break_threshold: Errors before breaking (default: 5)
- recovery_window: Seconds before retry (default: 300)
- min_healthy_instances: Required healthy instances (default: 1)

### HealthAwareLoadBalancer

Primary load balancer implementing:

- Instance health tracking
- Circuit breaker management
- Health-based routing
- Recovery coordination
- Metric collection

## Key Features

1. Health-Based Selection

   - Health score tracking
   - Instance filtering
   - Load distribution
   - Priority handling

2. Circuit Breaking

   - Error counting
   - Automatic breaking
   - Gradual recovery
   - State management

3. Health Monitoring

   - Continuous checking
   - Score calculation
   - Threshold management
   - Metric collection

4. Recovery Management
   - Progressive recovery
   - Score improvement
   - Circuit restoration
   - Failure tracking

## Implementation Details

### Instance Selection

```python
async def select_instance(
    self,
    service: str,
    instances: List[ServiceInstance]
) -> Optional[ServiceInstance]:
```

Selection Process:

1. Filter unhealthy instances
2. Check minimum healthy requirement
3. Apply health scores
4. Use strategy for final selection

### Health Management

- Score degradation on errors
- Gradual score improvement
- Circuit breaker integration
- Recovery coordination

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient health tracking
- Optimized instance selection
- Minimal overhead per request
- Resource-aware monitoring

## Security Considerations

- Protected health updates
- Validated instance selection
- Safe circuit breaking
- Resource protection

## Known Issues

1. Edge cases in partial recovery
2. Score calculation for burst errors
3. Recovery timing sensitivity

## Future Improvements

1. Add predictive health scoring
2. Implement adaptive thresholds
3. Improve memory usage for large instance sets
4. Add support for priority-based selection
5. Enhance recovery strategies
