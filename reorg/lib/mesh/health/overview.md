### 2. Health Aggregator (`health_aggregator.py`)

- Combines multiple health check results
- Provides unified health view
- Manages check registry
- Implements caching for performance
- Determines overall service status

### 3. Health-Aware Load Balancer (`health_aware_balancer.py`)

- Health-based instance selection
- Circuit breaking for fault isolation
- Gradual recovery mechanisms
- Health score tracking
- Continuous monitoring

### 4. Health Metrics (`health_metrics.py`, `health_aware_metrics.py`)

- Service health status tracking
- Dependency monitoring
- Resource usage metrics
- Latency tracking
- Failure rate monitoring

### 5. Health Trend Analysis (`health_trend_analyzer.py`)

- Time series analysis of health scores
- Trend direction classification
- Future state prediction
- Confidence scoring
- Service-level aggregation

### 6. Monitoring (`monitoring.py`)

- Real-time health monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Multi-level alerting
- Historical metrics retention

### 7. Reporting (`reporting.py`)

- Multiple output formats (JSON, HTML, CSV, Markdown, Excel)
- Various report types (summary, detailed, metrics, alerts, trends)
- Retention policies
- Automated cleanup
- Visual representations
