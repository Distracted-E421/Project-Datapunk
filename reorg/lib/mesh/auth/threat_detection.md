# Threat Detection System (threat_detection.py)

## Purpose

Implements real-time threat detection and response for the Datapunk service mesh using a combination of rule-based detection and pattern analysis to identify and respond to security threats.

## Context

Core security component that monitors and responds to potential security threats across the service mesh.

## Dependencies

- Security Metrics: For threat monitoring
- Security Auditor: For event logging
- Time utilities: For event tracking
- Logging system: For threat alerts

## Core Components

### ThreatLevel Enum

Threat severity classification:

```python
class ThreatLevel(Enum):
    LOW = "low"           # Potential anomaly, monitoring required
    MEDIUM = "medium"     # Confirmed anomaly, increased monitoring
    HIGH = "high"         # Active threat, protective action required
    CRITICAL = "critical" # Severe threat, immediate response required
```

### ThreatRule Class

Threat detection rule configuration:

```python
@dataclass
class ThreatRule:
    name: str
    threshold: int
    time_window: int  # seconds
    threat_level: ThreatLevel
    cooldown: int  # seconds
```

### ThreatEvent Class

Security event container:

```python
@dataclass
class ThreatEvent:
    service_id: str
    source_ip: str
    event_type: str
    timestamp: float
    details: Dict[str, any]
```

### ThreatDetector Class

Real-time threat detection and response:

- Event processing
- Rule evaluation
- Threat response
- Security monitoring

## Implementation Details

### Event Processing

```python
async def process_event(self, event: ThreatEvent) -> Optional[ThreatLevel]:
```

Steps:

1. Cooldown verification
2. Event tracking
3. Rule evaluation
4. Threat response

### Rule Evaluation

```python
async def _check_rules(self, source_ip: str) -> Optional[ThreatLevel]:
```

Process:

1. Time window analysis
2. Event counting
3. Threshold comparison
4. Threat level determination

### Threat Response

```python
async def _handle_threat(self, event: ThreatEvent, threat_level: ThreatLevel) -> None:
```

Actions:

1. IP blocking
2. Cooldown enforcement
3. Audit logging
4. Metric recording

## Performance Considerations

- Memory-efficient event tracking
- Automatic cleanup
- Optimized rule checking
- Minimal processing overhead

## Security Considerations

- Event data validation
- Secure state management
- Thread-safe operations
- Error handling

## Known Issues

- Machine learning thresholds needed
- Custom response actions pending
- Pattern analysis improvements needed

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

### Event Storage

- **Decision**: In-memory tracking
- **Rationale**: Fast threat detection
- **Trade-off**: Memory vs. detection speed

### Rule Processing

- **Decision**: Rule-based detection
- **Rationale**: Clear, configurable logic
- **Trade-off**: Simplicity vs. sophistication

### Response Actions

- **Decision**: IP-based blocking
- **Rationale**: Immediate threat mitigation
- **Trade-off**: Granularity vs. effectiveness

## Future Improvements

1. Add machine learning thresholds
2. Implement custom response actions
3. Enhance pattern analysis
4. Add threat correlation
5. Improve state management

## Testing Considerations

1. Detection accuracy
2. False positive rates
3. Performance impact
4. Memory usage
5. Concurrent events
6. Rule effectiveness
7. Response timing

## Example Usage

```python
# Process security event
event = ThreatEvent(
    service_id="api_service",
    source_ip="10.0.0.1",
    event_type="auth_failure",
    timestamp=time.time(),
    details={"attempt": 5}
)
threat_level = await detector.process_event(event)

# Check threat status
if threat_level in [ThreatLevel.HIGH, ThreatLevel.CRITICAL]:
    print(f"High severity threat detected: {threat_level}")
```
