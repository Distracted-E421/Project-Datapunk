# Role Management System

## Purpose

Implements a distributed role-based access control (RBAC) system with comprehensive role lifecycle management, caching, and audit capabilities.

## Context

The role manager is a core security component handling role creation, assignment, revocation, and inheritance while maintaining consistency across distributed systems.

## Dependencies

- Cache Client
- Metrics Client
- Audit Logger
- Structlog

## Key Components

### Role Assignment

```python
@dataclass
class RoleAssignment:
    user_id: str
    role_name: str
    assigned_by: str
    assigned_at: datetime
    expires_at: Optional[datetime] = None
    metadata: Optional[Dict] = None
```

Represents role assignments with:

- Temporal constraints
- Assignment context
- Optional metadata

### Role Manager

```python
class RoleManager:
    def __init__(self,
                 cache_client: CacheClient,
                 metrics: MetricsClient,
                 audit_logger: AuditLogger):
```

Core functionality:

- Role lifecycle management
- Assignment handling
- Cache consistency
- Audit logging

## Implementation Details

### Role Creation

```python
async def create_role(self,
                     role: Role,
                     created_by: str) -> bool:
```

Features:

- Parent role validation
- Circular inheritance prevention
- Atomic operations
- Cache updates

### Role Assignment

```python
async def assign_role(self,
                     assignment: RoleAssignment) -> bool:
```

Process:

1. Role validation
2. Assignment storage
3. Cache invalidation
4. Metrics collection

### Role Revocation

```python
async def revoke_role(self,
                     user_id: str,
                     role_name: str,
                     revoked_by: str) -> bool:
```

Operations:

- Assignment removal
- Cache updates
- Audit logging
- Metrics tracking

### User Role Retrieval

```python
async def get_user_roles(self, user_id: str) -> List[Role]:
```

Caching strategy:

1. Compiled role cache (1h TTL)
2. Individual assignments
3. Cache rebuilding

## Performance Considerations

- Two-level caching strategy
- Atomic operations
- Cache invalidation patterns
- Assignment lookup optimization

## Security Considerations

- Role inheritance validation
- Assignment expiration
- Audit trail completeness
- Cache consistency

## Known Issues

- Race conditions in cache updates
- No distributed locking
- Limited inheritance depth checks
- Manual cache invalidation

## Future Improvements

1. Cache Management:

   - Distributed locking
   - Efficient updates
   - Inheritance depth limits
   - Cache warming

2. Role Hierarchy:

   - Graph-based inheritance
   - Circular detection
   - Permission calculation
   - Role composition

3. Security Features:

   - Role approval workflows
   - Dynamic permissions
   - Temporary assignments
   - Emergency access

4. Monitoring:
   - Cache hit ratios
   - Assignment patterns
   - Permission usage
   - Performance metrics
