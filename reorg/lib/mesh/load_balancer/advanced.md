# Advanced Load Balancing Features

## Purpose

Implements sophisticated load balancing strategies and features for complex service mesh deployments, providing resource-aware, geographical, and adaptive load distribution.

## Context

These advanced features extend the core load balancer to handle complex deployment scenarios and optimize for specific service requirements.

## Dependencies

- Load Balancer Core
- Health Monitoring System
- Metrics Collection System
- Circuit Breaker Integration

## Key Features

### Resource-Aware Load Balancing

```python
class ResourceAwareStrategy(LoadBalancingStrategy):
```

Selects instances based on resource utilization:

- CPU usage (40% weight)
- Memory usage (30% weight)
- Connection count (30% weight)
- Health score adjustment

### Geographical Load Balancing

```python
class GeographicalStrategy(LoadBalancingStrategy):
```

Routes requests based on location:

- Same-region prioritization
- Fallback to cross-region
- Latency optimization
- Region health awareness

### Consistent Hashing

```python
class ConsistentHashingStrategy(LoadBalancingStrategy):
```

Provides stable request routing:

- Multiple virtual nodes per instance
- Hash ring implementation
- Minimal redistribution on changes
- Health-aware node selection

## Implementation Details

### Resource Scoring

```python
def load_score(instance: ServiceInstance) -> float:
    cpu_weight = 0.4
    memory_weight = 0.3
    conn_weight = 0.3

    cpu_score = instance.metadata.get("cpu_usage", 0.5)
    memory_score = instance.metadata.get("memory_usage", 0.5)
    conn_score = instance.active_connections / 100

    return (cpu_score * cpu_weight +
            memory_score * memory_weight +
            conn_score * conn_weight) / instance.health_score
```

### Geographic Selection

```python
def select_instance(self,
                   service: str,
                   instances: List[ServiceInstance],
                   client_region: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[ServiceInstance]:
```

- Prioritizes same-region instances
- Falls back to random selection
- Requires region metadata

### Hash Ring Management

```python
def _build_ring(self, instances: List[ServiceInstance]):
    self._hash_ring.clear()
    for instance in instances:
        for i in range(self.replicas):
            hash_key = self._hash_key(f"{instance.id}:{i}")
            self._hash_ring[hash_key] = instance.id
```

## Performance Considerations

- Resource metrics collection overhead
- Hash ring rebuild impact
- Geographic routing latency
- Memory usage for virtual nodes

## Security Considerations

- Resource metrics validation
- Geographic data protection
- Hash ring manipulation prevention
- Cross-region security policies

## Known Issues

- Resource metrics may be stale
- Region failover latency spikes
- Hash ring rebuilds can be costly
- Limited geographic granularity

## Future Improvements

- Dynamic resource weight adjustment
- Multi-region hash rings
- Predictive geographic routing
- Resource usage prediction
