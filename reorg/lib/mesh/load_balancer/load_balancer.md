# Load Balancer Core Component

## Purpose

The core load balancer component provides dynamic request distribution across service instances with health awareness and performance monitoring capabilities.

## Context

This component is central to the Datapunk service mesh's traffic management system, working in conjunction with service discovery and health monitoring to ensure reliable request routing.

## Dependencies

- Service Discovery Registry
- Health Monitoring System
- Metrics Collection System
- Load Balancing Strategies

## Key Features

- Multiple load balancing strategies (Round Robin, Least Connections, Weighted, Random)
- Health-aware instance selection
- Dynamic instance registration/removal
- Performance metrics collection
- Configurable health thresholds
- Connection tracking
- Automatic instance recovery

## Implementation Details

### Service Instance

```python
@dataclass
class ServiceInstance:
    id: str
    address: str
    port: int
    weight: int = 1
    last_used: float = 0
    active_connections: int = 0
    health_score: float = 1.0
```

The `ServiceInstance` class represents a backend service endpoint with:

- Unique identifier
- Network location (address/port)
- Capacity weight for load distribution
- Connection tracking
- Health scoring

### Load Balancer Configuration

```python
@dataclass
class LoadBalancerConfig:
    strategy_type: Type[LoadBalancingStrategy] = AdaptiveStrategy
    health_check_interval: float = 5.0
    health_check_timeout: float = 1.0
    error_threshold: int = 3
    recovery_threshold: int = 2
    metrics_enabled: bool = True
```

Configuration parameters control:

- Strategy selection
- Health check timing
- Error thresholds
- Recovery behavior
- Metrics collection

## Core Operations

### Instance Registration

```python
async def register_instance(self, service_name: str, instance: ServiceInstance)
```

- Adds new service instance to load balancer
- Initializes health tracking
- Updates metrics

### Instance Selection

```python
async def get_instance(self, service_name: str) -> Optional[ServiceInstance]
```

- Selects next instance using configured strategy
- Considers instance health
- Records selection metrics

### Health Updates

```python
async def update_instance_health(self, service_name: str, instance_id: str, health_score: float)
```

- Updates instance health scores
- Influences selection probability
- Triggers metrics updates

## Performance Considerations

- Strategy selection impacts request distribution patterns
- Health check frequency affects detection speed vs overhead
- Metric collection adds minor performance overhead
- Connection tracking requires memory per instance

## Security Considerations

- Load balancer requires access to service health endpoints
- Metrics may contain sensitive performance data
- Instance registration should be authenticated
- Health updates should be validated

## Known Issues

- May show slight bias towards higher-weighted instances
- Connection counts may be slightly stale due to async updates
- Requires manual strategy selection (no auto-adaptation)

## Future Improvements

- Add circuit breaker integration
- Implement strategy auto-switching based on load patterns
- Add support for service-specific configurations
- Implement connection draining for graceful shutdown
