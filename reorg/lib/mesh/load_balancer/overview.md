# Load Balancer Module Overview

## Purpose

The load balancer module provides intelligent request distribution across service instances in the Datapunk service mesh, ensuring optimal resource utilization, high availability, and performance.

## Architecture

The module consists of several key components:

### Core Load Balancer (`load_balancer.md`)

- Basic request distribution
- Instance management
- Health integration
- Strategy selection

### Load Balancing Strategies (`strategies.md`)

- Multiple algorithm implementations
- Health-aware selection
- Adaptive behavior
- Performance optimization

### Metrics System (`metrics.md`)

- Performance monitoring
- Health tracking
- Resource utilization
- Prometheus integration

### Advanced Features (`advanced.md`)

- Resource-aware balancing
- Geographic routing
- Consistent hashing
- Advanced configurations

## Key Features

1. Multiple Load Balancing Strategies:

   - Round Robin
   - Least Connections
   - Weighted Round Robin
   - Power of Two Choices
   - Resource Aware
   - Geographic Routing
   - Consistent Hashing

2. Health Awareness:

   - Dynamic health scoring
   - Automatic instance exclusion
   - Recovery detection
   - Health-weighted selection

3. Performance Monitoring:

   - Request tracking
   - Latency measurement
   - Error detection
   - Resource utilization

4. Advanced Capabilities:
   - Resource-based selection
   - Geographic optimization
   - Consistent request routing
   - Adaptive strategy switching

## Integration Points

1. Service Discovery:

   - Instance registration
   - Health updates
   - Metadata synchronization

2. Health Monitoring:

   - Health score updates
   - Instance status tracking
   - Recovery detection

3. Metrics Collection:

   - Performance data
   - Health metrics
   - Resource utilization
   - Request patterns

4. Circuit Breaker:
   - Failure detection
   - Load shedding
   - Recovery management

## Configuration

```python
@dataclass
class LoadBalancerConfig:
    strategy_type: Type[LoadBalancingStrategy] = AdaptiveStrategy
    health_check_interval: float = 5.0
    health_check_timeout: float = 1.0
    error_threshold: int = 3
    recovery_threshold: int = 2
    metrics_enabled: bool = True
```

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize load balancer
lb = LoadBalancer(
    strategy=LoadBalancerStrategy.ADAPTIVE,
    metrics_enabled=True
)

# Register instance
await lb.register_instance(
    service_name="auth-service",
    instance=ServiceInstance(
        id="auth-1",
        address="10.0.0.1",
        port=8080
    )
)

# Get next instance
instance = await lb.get_instance("auth-service")

# Update health
await lb.update_instance_health(
    service_name="auth-service",
    instance_id="auth-1",
    health_score=0.8
)
```

## Performance Considerations

- Strategy selection impacts distribution patterns
- Health checks add monitoring overhead
- Metrics collection requires resources
- Geographic routing may add latency

## Security Considerations

- Instance authentication required
- Metrics access control needed
- Resource data validation
- Geographic data protection

## Known Issues

- Strategy switching overhead
- Stale health data possible
- Resource metrics latency
- Geographic routing complexity

## Future Improvements

1. Enhanced Features:

   - Auto-scaling integration
   - ML-based strategy selection
   - Predictive load balancing
   - Custom strategy plugins

2. Performance Optimization:

   - Reduced switching overhead
   - Faster health propagation
   - Efficient resource monitoring
   - Geographic routing optimization

3. Security Enhancements:
   - Enhanced authentication
   - Metric data protection
   - Resource validation
   - Cross-region security
