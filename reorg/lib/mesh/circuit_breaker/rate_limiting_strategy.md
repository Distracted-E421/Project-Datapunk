# Rate Limiting Strategy

## Purpose

Implements a rate limiting strategy that controls request rates using multiple algorithms and adapts limits based on system load and performance metrics.

## Context

Rate control component of the circuit breaker system, managing request flow and preventing system overload.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- asyncio: For async operations
- time: For timing control
- collections: For data structures

## Features

- Multiple rate limiting algorithms
- Adaptive rate adjustment
- Burst handling
- Window-based tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Dynamic configuration
- Automatic scaling

## Core Components

### RateLimitAlgorithm

Available algorithms:

- TOKEN_BUCKET: Classic token bucket
- LEAKY_BUCKET: Leaky bucket control
- FIXED_WINDOW: Time window counting
- SLIDING_WINDOW: Moving window tracking
- ADAPTIVE: Dynamic adjustment

### RateLimitingStrategy

Main rate control:

- Algorithm selection
- Rate management
- Burst control
- Adaptation logic
- Metric collection

### Bucket Implementations

Algorithm-specific controls:

- TokenBucket: Rate-based tokens
- LeakyBucket: Constant outflow
- FixedWindow: Time-based slots
- SlidingWindow: Moving slots

## Key Methods

### should_allow_request()

Controls request admission:

1. Checks limits
2. Applies algorithm
3. Updates state
4. Records metrics
5. Makes decision

### adjust_rate()

Manages rate adaptation:

1. Analyzes performance
2. Checks errors
3. Updates limits
4. Applies changes

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient algorithms
- Optimized state tracking
- Minimal overhead
- Fast decisions

## Security Considerations

- Protected rate changes
- Validated updates
- Resource protection
- Safe adaptation

## Known Issues

None documented

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Algorithm Selection:

   - Multiple vs single
   - Complexity vs features
   - Adaptation capability

2. Rate Management:

   - Static vs dynamic
   - Update frequency
   - Burst handling

3. Window Design:

   - Fixed vs sliding
   - Size selection
   - Memory usage

4. Adaptation Strategy:
   - Aggressiveness
   - Stability
   - Recovery speed
