# Health-Aware Circuit Breaking

## Purpose

Implements health-aware decision making for circuit breaking based on service health metrics, system resource utilization, historical performance data, and dependencies health status.

## Context

Health monitoring component of the circuit breaker system, making circuit breaking decisions based on comprehensive health metrics.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- asyncio: For async operations
- statistics: For calculations
- Metric collection
- Resource monitoring

## Features

- Service health metrics
- System resource utilization
- Historical performance data
- Dependencies health status
- Resource type monitoring
- Health status tracking
- Adaptive thresholds

## Core Components

### HealthStatus

Health state classification:

- HEALTHY: Normal operation
- DEGRADED: Partial issues
- UNHEALTHY: Major problems
- UNKNOWN: Status unclear

### ResourceType

Monitored resources:

- CPU: Processor utilization
- MEMORY: Memory usage
- DISK: Storage utilization
- NETWORK: Network capacity
- CONNECTIONS: Connection pool

### HealthAwareBreaker

Main health monitoring:

- Health checking
- Resource monitoring
- Threshold management
- Decision making
- Metric collection

## Key Methods

### check_health()

Evaluates service health:

1. Checks resources
2. Monitors metrics
3. Evaluates dependencies
4. Determines status
5. Updates tracking

### should_allow_request()

Makes request decisions:

1. Checks health status
2. Evaluates resources
3. Considers priority
4. Applies thresholds
5. Records decision

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient health checks
- Optimized resource monitoring
- Smart metric collection
- Minimal overhead

## Security Considerations

- Protected health updates
- Validated metrics
- Resource protection
- Safe decisions

## Known Issues

None documented

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Health Checking:

   - Comprehensive vs overhead
   - Check frequency
   - Metric selection

2. Resource Monitoring:

   - Coverage vs impact
   - Update frequency
   - Threshold management

3. Decision Making:

   - Speed vs accuracy
   - Factor weighting
   - Priority handling

4. State Management:
   - Update frequency
   - History retention
   - Recovery rules
