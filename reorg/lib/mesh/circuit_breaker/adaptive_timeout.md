# Adaptive Timeout Management

## Purpose

Implements dynamic timeout adjustment based on service performance metrics and statistical analysis to optimize timeout values and reduce false positives.

## Context

Part of the circuit breaker's reliability mechanism, ensuring appropriate timeout values that adapt to service behavior and system conditions.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- numpy: For statistical calculations
- metrics_client: For monitoring
- datetime: For time tracking

## Features

- Multiple timeout strategies:
  - Percentile-based
  - Adaptive
  - Hybrid (combined approach)
- Response time tracking
- Success rate monitoring
- Statistical analysis
- Outlier detection

## Core Components

### TimeoutConfig

Configuration for timeout management:

- min_timeout_ms: Minimum timeout value
- max_timeout_ms: Maximum timeout value
- initial_timeout_ms: Starting timeout value
- strategy: Selected timeout strategy
- window_size: Sample window size
- percentile: Target percentile for calculations
- adjustment_factor: Multiplier for adjustments

### ResponseTimeTracker

Tracks response times for timeout calculation:

- Rolling window of response times
- Success/failure tracking
- Statistical calculations
- Success rate monitoring

### AdaptiveTimeout

Main class implementing timeout management:

- Dynamic timeout adjustment
- Strategy-based calculations
- Health monitoring
- Metric reporting

## Key Methods

### get_timeout()

Calculates current timeout value using:

1. Historical response times
2. Success rates
3. Selected strategy
4. System conditions

### record_response_time()

Records response metrics:

1. Updates response time history
2. Tracks success/failure rates
3. Updates health metrics
4. Triggers adjustments

## Performance Considerations

- Uses efficient statistical calculations
- Maintains bounded history size
- Implements configurable limits
- Minimal overhead per request

## Security Considerations

N/A - Internal utility module

## Known Issues

None documented

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Strategy Selection:

   - Multiple strategies vs single approach
   - Allows optimization for different scenarios
   - Increased configuration complexity

2. Statistical Analysis:

   - Rolling window vs full history
   - Memory efficient but may miss long-term patterns
   - Good balance of accuracy vs resources

3. Adjustment Approach:
   - Gradual adjustments vs immediate changes
   - More stable but slower to adapt
   - Prevents oscillation
