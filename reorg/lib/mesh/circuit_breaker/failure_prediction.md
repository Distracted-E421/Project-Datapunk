# Circuit Breaker Failure Prediction

## Purpose

Implements predictive failure detection for the circuit breaker system using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to predict service failures before they occur.

## Context

Predictive component of the circuit breaker system, analyzing patterns and metrics to anticipate and prevent failures.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- numpy: For statistical analysis
- asyncio: For async operations
- Metric collection
- Time series analysis

## Features

- Time series analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Anomaly detection
- Resource utilization prediction
- Error rate forecasting
- Multiple prediction metrics
- Confidence scoring

## Core Components

### PredictionMetric

Monitored metrics:

- ERROR_RATE: Service errors
- LATENCY: Response times
- CPU_USAGE: Processor load
- MEMORY_USAGE: Memory consumption
- REQUEST_RATE: Traffic volume
- QUEUE_SIZE: Request queuing

### FailurePredictor

Main prediction engine:

- Pattern analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Trend analysis
- Threshold management
- Confidence calculation

### MetricHistory

Historical data management:

- Time series storage
- Window management
- Statistical analysis
- Pattern detection

## Key Methods

### predict_failure()

Analyzes failure likelihood:

1. Checks current metrics
2. Detects anomalies
3. Analyzes trends
4. Calculates confidence
5. Makes prediction

### update_thresholds()

Manages detection thresholds:

1. Analyzes history
2. Updates baselines
3. Adjusts sensitivity
4. Adapts to patterns

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient time series storage
- Optimized calculations
- Bounded history size
- Resource-aware analysis

## Security Considerations

- Protected metric access
- Validated updates
- Resource limits
- Safe predictions

## Known Issues

None documented

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Prediction Approach:

   - Statistical vs ML-based
   - Accuracy vs speed
   - Resource usage

2. Metric Selection:

   - Coverage vs overhead
   - Update frequency
   - Storage requirements

3. Window Management:

   - Size vs accuracy
   - Memory usage
   - Pattern detection

4. Threshold Handling:
   - Static vs dynamic
   - Adaptation speed
   - False positive control
