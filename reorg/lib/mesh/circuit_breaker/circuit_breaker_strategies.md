# Circuit Breaker Strategies

## Purpose

Implements configurable failure detection and recovery strategies for the circuit breaker system, providing flexible reliability patterns adaptable to different service characteristics.

## Context

Strategy component of the service mesh reliability system, defining how circuit breakers detect failures and manage recovery.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- datapunk.lib.exceptions: For error handling
- datapunk_shared.monitoring: For metrics
- Metric types and monitoring integration

## Features

- Configurable failure detection
- Adaptive recovery patterns
- State transition management
- Performance impact control
- Metric integration
- Multiple strategy implementations

## Core Components

### CircuitState

Circuit breaker state machine:

- CLOSED: Normal operation
- OPEN: Failure detected
- HALF_OPEN: Testing recovery

### CircuitBreakerStrategy

Base strategy interface:

- Failure detection logic
- Recovery management
- State transitions
- Metric reporting

### GradualRecoveryStrategy

Progressive recovery implementation:

1. Initial testing (10% traffic)
2. Gradual increase (10% -> 50%)
3. Full recovery (50% -> 100%)

## Key Methods

### should_open()

Determines if circuit should open:

1. Evaluates failure patterns
2. Checks error rates
3. Considers traffic volume
4. Analyzes metrics

### should_close()

Controls recovery process:

1. Tests stability
2. Monitors error rates
3. Manages transitions
4. Prevents oscillation

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient state management
- Optimized calculations
- Minimal overhead
- Resource awareness

## Security Considerations

- Protected state transitions
- Validated metrics
- Safe recovery

## Known Issues

1. ML-based failure prediction pending
2. Gradual recovery patterns need enhancement

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Strategy Design:

   - Interface-based vs inheritance
   - Flexibility vs complexity
   - Runtime configuration

2. State Management:

   - Three-state vs multi-state
   - Transition control
   - Recovery granularity

3. Recovery Approach:

   - Gradual vs immediate
   - Testing methodology
   - Traffic management

4. Metric Integration:
   - Required vs optional
   - Collection overhead
   - Analysis depth
