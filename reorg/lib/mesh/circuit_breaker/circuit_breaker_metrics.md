# Circuit Breaker Metrics

## Purpose

Implements comprehensive monitoring for circuit breaker behavior across the service mesh, providing real-time visibility into service reliability patterns and failure cascades.

## Context

Monitoring component of the service mesh reliability system, tracking and analyzing circuit breaker behavior and performance impacts.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- prometheus_client: For metrics collection
- Prometheus metric types:
  - Counter
  - Gauge
  - Histogram

## Features

- Circuit state transitions
- Request success/failure rates
- Recovery timing analysis
- Error rate tracking
- Performance impact measurement
- Real-time monitoring
- Historical pattern analysis

## Core Components

### CircuitBreakerMetrics

Main metrics collection class:

- State tracking
- Request monitoring
- Failure analysis
- Performance measurement
- Pattern detection

### Metric Categories

Key metric types tracked:

1. State Metrics:

   - Current circuit state
   - State transition counts
   - Time in each state

2. Request Metrics:

   - Total requests
   - Success/failure counts
   - Rejection counts
   - Response times

3. Health Metrics:
   - Error rates
   - Recovery times
   - Performance impact

## Key Methods

### record_request()

Records request metrics:

1. Updates counters
2. Measures duration
3. Tracks status
4. Updates histograms

### record_state_change()

Tracks state transitions:

1. Updates state gauge
2. Records transition
3. Measures duration
4. Updates patterns

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient metric collection
- Optimized label cardinality
- Bounded history size
- Minimal request impact

## Security Considerations

- Protected metric access
- Validated updates
- Resource protection
- Data isolation

## Known Issues

None documented

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Metric Selection:

   - Comprehensive vs overhead
   - Cardinality management
   - Storage efficiency

2. Collection Strategy:

   - Real-time vs batched
   - Accuracy vs performance
   - Resource usage

3. Label Usage:

   - Granularity vs cardinality
   - Query performance
   - Storage impact

4. History Management:
   - Retention periods
   - Resolution
   - Storage requirements
