# Dependency Chain Management

## Purpose

Provides dependency tracking and management for service dependencies, helping prevent cascading failures and coordinate recovery across dependent services.

## Context

Core dependency management component of the circuit breaker system, tracking relationships between services and their health status.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- asyncio: For async operations
- Metric collection
- Health monitoring

## Features

- Service dependency tracking
- Health status monitoring
- Dependency type classification
- Impact analysis
- Recovery coordination
- State propagation

## Core Components

### DependencyType

Dependency classification:

- CRITICAL: Service cannot function without
- REQUIRED: Needed for core functionality
- OPTIONAL: Can operate with degraded functionality
- FALLBACK: Used when primary fails

### HealthStatus

Health state tracking:

- HEALTHY: Normal operation
- DEGRADED: Partial functionality
- UNHEALTHY: Not functioning
- UNKNOWN: Status unclear

### DependencyChain

Main dependency management:

- Relationship tracking
- Health monitoring
- Recovery coordination
- Impact analysis

## Key Methods

### update_health()

Manages health status:

1. Updates service health
2. Propagates changes
3. Triggers recovery
4. Notifies dependents

### check_dependency_health()

Evaluates dependency health:

1. Checks current status
2. Considers dependency type
3. Evaluates impact
4. Makes availability decisions

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient health checking
- Optimized propagation
- Smart caching
- Minimal overhead

## Security Considerations

- Protected updates
- Validated changes
- Safe propagation
- Resource protection

## Known Issues

None documented

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Dependency Types:

   - Fixed vs dynamic classification
   - Impact calculation
   - Recovery priorities

2. Health Monitoring:

   - Check frequency
   - Propagation depth
   - State caching

3. Recovery Coordination:

   - Centralized vs distributed
   - Synchronization approach
   - Consistency requirements

4. State Management:
   - Update frequency
   - Propagation rules
   - Cache invalidation
