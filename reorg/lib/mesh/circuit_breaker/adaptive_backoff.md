# Adaptive Backoff System

## Purpose

Provides intelligent backoff strategies that adapt to system conditions and failure patterns for the circuit breaker system.

## Context

Part of the circuit breaker's recovery mechanism, managing how services back off and retry after failures.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- numpy: For statistical calculations
- asyncio: For async operations
- metrics_client: For monitoring

## Features

- Multiple backoff strategies:
  - Exponential backoff
  - Fibonacci backoff
  - Decorrelated jitter
  - Resource-sensitive backoff
  - Pattern-based backoff
  - Adaptive backoff
- Dynamic strategy selection
- Pattern detection
- Resource awareness
- Metric integration

## Core Components

### BackoffConfig

Configuration parameters for backoff behavior:

- initial_delay: Starting delay in seconds
- max_delay: Maximum delay cap
- multiplier: Factor for exponential growth
- jitter: Randomization factor
- pattern_window: Time window for pattern analysis
- resource_threshold: Resource utilization threshold

### AdaptiveBackoff

Main class implementing adaptive backoff logic:

- Strategy selection based on effectiveness
- Pattern detection and analysis
- Resource-aware delay calculation
- Success/failure tracking
- Metric reporting

## Key Methods

### get_delay()

Calculates next backoff delay using:

1. Current system conditions
2. Historical success/failure patterns
3. Resource utilization
4. Selected strategy effectiveness

### record_attempt()

Records attempt outcomes to:

1. Update strategy effectiveness
2. Analyze patterns
3. Adjust future delays
4. Report metrics

## Performance Considerations

- Uses efficient pattern detection algorithms
- Maintains bounded history size
- Implements configurable limits
- Avoids expensive computations in critical path

## Security Considerations

N/A - Internal utility module

## Known Issues

None documented

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Strategy Selection:

   - Uses weighted combination vs single strategy
   - Allows dynamic adaptation to conditions
   - Slightly higher complexity

2. Pattern Detection:

   - Limited window size for memory efficiency
   - May miss very long-term patterns
   - Good balance of accuracy vs resources

3. Resource Awareness:
   - Optional resource monitoring
   - Adds overhead but prevents cascading failures
   - Configurable thresholds
