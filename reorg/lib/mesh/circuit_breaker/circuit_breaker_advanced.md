- Multiple strategy modules:
  - Circuit breaker strategies
  - Gradual recovery
  - Metrics collection
  - Adaptive timeout
  - Failure prediction
  - Request priority
  - Partial recovery
  - Health monitoring
  - Service discovery
  - Rate limiting

## Features

- Multiple circuit breaker strategies
- Enhanced failure detection
- Sophisticated recovery patterns

## Core Components

### AdvancedCircuitBreaker

Main class orchestrating circuit breaker behavior:

- Strategy management
- Component coordination
- State tracking
- Metric collection
- Health monitoring

### Strategy Types

Available circuit breaker strategies:

- Basic: Standard circuit breaking
- Gradual: Progressive recovery
- Dependency: Dependency-aware decisions

## Key Methods

### should_allow_request()

Determines if request should proceed by checking:

1. Rate limits
2. Failure predictions
3. Resource availability
4. Health status
5. Service discovery
6. Circuit breaker state

### record_success()/record_failure()

Records request outcomes:

1. Updates strategy state
2. Records metrics
3. Updates health status
4. Adjusts recovery behavior
5. Updates rate limits

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient state management
- Optimized component coordination
- Minimal per-request overhead
- Configurable feature set

## Security Considerations

- Protected state transitions
- Validated configuration
- Safe dependency handling
- Resource protection

## Known Issues

None documented

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Component Architecture:

   - Modular design vs integration complexity
   - Flexible configuration vs setup overhead
   - Enhanced features vs performance impact

2. Strategy Selection:

   - Multiple strategies vs simplicity
   - Runtime strategy switching
   - Configuration complexity

3. Feature Integration:

   - Comprehensive monitoring
   - Resource overhead
   - Configurable components

4. State Management:
   - Distributed state handling
   - Consistency vs availability
   - Recovery coordination
