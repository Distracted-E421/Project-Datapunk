# Recovery Patterns

## Purpose

Implements advanced recovery and fallback mechanisms for the circuit breaker system, providing configurable patterns for graceful degradation and service recovery in failure scenarios.

## Context

Recovery pattern component of the circuit breaker system, defining how services recover from failures and maintain partial functionality.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- asyncio: For async operations
- Cache client: For fallback data
- Metrics client: For monitoring

## Features

- Multiple recovery strategies
- Fallback chain management
- Cache-based degradation
- Alternative service routing
- Partial functionality support
- Progressive recovery
- Failure handling

## Core Components

### RecoveryPattern

Base pattern interface:

- Recovery logic
- Success handling
- Failure management
- State tracking

### ExponentialBackoffPattern

Backoff implementation:

- Increasing delays
- Maximum retries
- Jitter addition
- Success tracking

### PartialRecoveryPattern

Gradual recovery:

- Feature prioritization
- Load management
- Health monitoring
- State coordination

### AdaptiveRecoveryPattern

Dynamic adaptation:

- Load awareness
- Performance monitoring
- Resource checking
- Rate adjustment

## Key Methods

### should_attempt_recovery()

Evaluates recovery timing:

1. Checks conditions
2. Calculates delays
3. Considers health
4. Makes decision

### handle_success()/handle_failure()

Manages outcomes:

1. Updates state
2. Adjusts strategy
3. Records metrics
4. Plans next steps

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient state tracking
- Optimized calculations
- Smart retries
- Resource awareness

## Security Considerations

- Protected state changes
- Validated transitions
- Safe fallbacks
- Resource protection

## Known Issues

None documented

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Recovery Strategy:

   - Multiple patterns vs simplicity
   - Flexibility vs complexity
   - Configuration options

2. Fallback Management:

   - Chain depth
   - Cache usage
   - Alternative routing

3. State Tracking:

   - Granularity
   - History retention
   - Memory usage

4. Adaptation Logic:
   - Sensitivity
   - Response speed
   - Stability control
