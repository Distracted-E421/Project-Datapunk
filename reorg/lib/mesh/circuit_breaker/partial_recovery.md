# Partial Recovery Management

## Purpose

Implements gradual service recovery by selectively enabling features based on health metrics, priorities, and dependencies, allowing for controlled and safe service restoration.

## Context

Recovery management component of the circuit breaker system, handling progressive service restoration after failures.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- asyncio: For async operations
- Metric collection
- Feature management

## Features

- Gradual feature enablement
- Priority-based recovery
- Health monitoring
- Dependency tracking
- Feature state management
- Recovery coordination
- Automatic rollback

## Core Components

### FeatureState

Feature availability states:

- DISABLED: Feature inactive
- TESTING: Under evaluation
- ENABLED: Fully available

### FeatureHealth

Health status tracking:

- UNKNOWN: Initial state
- HEALTHY: Normal operation
- DEGRADED: Partial issues
- UNHEALTHY: Major problems

### PartialRecoveryManager

Main recovery coordination:

- Feature management
- Health tracking
- Recovery orchestration
- Rollback handling
- Metric collection

## Key Methods

### start_recovery()

Initiates recovery process:

1. Prioritizes features
2. Plans sequence
3. Starts monitoring
4. Begins testing

### test_feature()

Evaluates feature health:

1. Checks dependencies
2. Monitors performance
3. Tracks stability
4. Makes decisions

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient state tracking
- Optimized testing
- Smart monitoring
- Minimal overhead

## Security Considerations

- Protected state changes
- Validated transitions
- Safe testing
- Resource protection

## Known Issues

None documented

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Recovery Strategy:

   - Gradual vs immediate
   - Feature ordering
   - Testing duration

2. Health Evaluation:

   - Criteria selection
   - Threshold setting
   - Stability requirements

3. Dependency Handling:

   - Recovery ordering
   - Failure impact
   - Rollback triggers

4. Feature Management:
   - State granularity
   - Testing approach
   - Rollback strategy
