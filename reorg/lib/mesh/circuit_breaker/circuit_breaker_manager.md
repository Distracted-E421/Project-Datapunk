# Circuit Breaker Manager

## Purpose

Coordinates circuit breaker behavior across the Datapunk service mesh, providing centralized management and monitoring of service reliability patterns.

## Context

Central coordination component for the service mesh reliability system, managing circuit breaker instances and their interactions across services.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- datapunk.lib.exceptions: For error handling
- datapunk_shared.monitoring: For metrics
- datapunk_shared.cache: For state caching
- Circuit breaker strategies
- Circuit breaker base implementation

## Features

- Centralized circuit breaker management
- Dynamic configuration updates
- Cross-service failure correlation
- Real-time state monitoring
- Failure pattern analysis
- Service health tracking

## Core Components

### CircuitBreakerManager

Main coordination class:

- Circuit breaker instance management
- Configuration distribution
- State synchronization
- Pattern detection
- Health monitoring

### Instance Management

Handles circuit breaker lifecycle:

- Lazy instance creation
- Configuration updates
- State tracking
- Resource cleanup

## Key Methods

### manage_circuit_breaker()

Coordinates circuit breaker operations:

1. Instance creation/retrieval
2. Configuration application
3. State synchronization
4. Health monitoring

### update_configuration()

Manages configuration changes:

1. Validation
2. Distribution
3. State updates
4. Instance reconfiguration

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy instance creation
- Efficient state management
- Optimized coordination
- Resource pooling

## Security Considerations

- Protected configuration updates
- Validated state transitions
- Resource isolation
- Access control

## Known Issues

1. Cross-service failure correlation needs implementation
2. Adaptive threshold adjustment pending

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Instance Management:

   - Lazy creation vs eager initialization
   - Resource efficiency vs startup time
   - Simplified management

2. State Management:

   - Centralized vs distributed
   - Consistency vs availability
   - Coordination overhead

3. Configuration Handling:

   - Dynamic updates
   - Version management
   - Backward compatibility

4. Pattern Analysis:
   - Real-time vs batch processing
   - Memory usage vs accuracy
   - Analysis depth
