# Dependency-Aware Circuit Breaker Strategy

## Purpose

Implements a circuit breaker strategy that considers service dependencies when making circuit breaking decisions, allowing for more intelligent failure handling based on the health and status of dependencies.

## Context

Advanced strategy component of the circuit breaker system that understands and reacts to the health and state of service dependencies.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- asyncio: For async operations
- Circuit breaker strategies base
- Dependency chain management
- Health status tracking

## Features

- Dependency health monitoring
- Cascading failure prevention
- Smart recovery based on dependency status
- Failure impact analysis
- Health-aware request routing
- Dynamic dependency management

## Core Components

### DependencyAwareStrategy

Main strategy implementation:

- Dependency tracking
- Health monitoring
- Failure correlation
- Recovery coordination
- Impact analysis

### Dependency Management

Handles service relationships:

- Dependency registration
- Health tracking
- Impact scoring
- State synchronization

## Key Methods

### should_allow_request()

Makes request decisions based on:

1. Circuit breaker state
2. Dependency health
3. Critical dependencies
4. Resource availability
5. Health scores

### record_success()/record_failure()

Tracks outcomes considering:

1. Dependency impact
2. Health updates
3. Failure correlation
4. Recovery coordination
5. State propagation

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient health checks
- Optimized dependency tracking
- Smart state caching
- Minimal coordination overhead

## Security Considerations

- Protected dependency updates
- Validated health status
- Safe state transitions
- Resource isolation

## Known Issues

None documented

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Dependency Tracking:

   - Comprehensive vs overhead
   - Update frequency
   - State management

2. Health Monitoring:

   - Active vs passive
   - Check frequency
   - Resource usage

3. Recovery Strategy:

   - Dependency-aware recovery
   - Coordination complexity
   - State consistency

4. Impact Analysis:
   - Depth vs performance
   - Scoring methodology
   - Update frequency
