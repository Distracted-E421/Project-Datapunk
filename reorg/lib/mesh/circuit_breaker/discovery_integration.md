# Service Discovery Integration

## Purpose

Implements dynamic service discovery and connection management with service registration, health-based instance selection, connection pooling, and automatic failover handling.

## Context

Service discovery component of the circuit breaker system, managing service instance discovery and connection lifecycle.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- asyncio: For async operations
- Metric collection
- Connection pooling

## Features

- Service registration/deregistration
- Health-based instance selection
- Connection pooling
- Automatic failover
- Instance state management
- Dynamic configuration

## Core Components

### InstanceState

Service instance states:

- ACTIVE: Healthy and serving
- DRAINING: Gracefully shutting down
- INACTIVE: Not accepting connections
- FAILED: Health check failed

### ServiceInstance

Instance information tracking:

- Basic metadata
- Health metrics
- Connection stats
- State management

### DiscoveryIntegration

Main discovery management:

- Instance tracking
- Connection pooling
- Health monitoring
- Failover handling

## Key Methods

### register_instance()

Handles instance registration:

1. Validates instance data
2. Initializes tracking
3. Sets up monitoring
4. Prepares connections

### get_instance()

Selects service instances:

1. Filters by health
2. Considers connection limits
3. Applies selection strategy
4. Manages failover

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient instance selection
- Optimized connection pooling
- Smart health checking
- Resource management

## Security Considerations

- Protected registration
- Validated instances
- Secure connections
- Resource limits

## Known Issues

None documented

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Instance Selection:

   - Health-based vs round-robin
   - Connection limits
   - Failover strategy

2. Connection Management:

   - Pooling vs direct
   - Pool sizes
   - Cleanup timing

3. Health Checking:

   - Active vs passive
   - Check frequency
   - Timeout handling

4. State Management:
   - Transition rules
   - Recovery process
   - Cleanup timing
