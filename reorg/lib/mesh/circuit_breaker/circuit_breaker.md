# Core Circuit Breaker

## Purpose

Provides fundamental circuit breaker pattern implementation for the service mesh, preventing cascading failures by automatically detecting and isolating failing service dependencies.

## Context

Base implementation component of the service mesh reliability system, providing core circuit breaking functionality that other components build upon.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- asyncio: For async operations
- Distributed tracing integration
- Decorator support
- Metric collection

## Features

- Three-state failure management
- Automatic recovery testing
- Distributed tracing integration
- Decorator-based usage
- Configurable thresholds
- State machine implementation

## Core Components

### CircuitState

State machine enumeration:

- CLOSED: Normal operation
- OPEN: Failure detected
- HALF_OPEN: Testing recovery

### CircuitBreaker

Base circuit breaker implementation:

- State management
- Failure detection
- Recovery control
- Tracing integration
- Metric collection

### circuit_breaker

Decorator for service methods:

- Automatic protection
- State management
- Success/failure tracking
- Tracing context

## Key Methods

### can_execute()

Controls request flow:

1. Checks current state
2. Manages transitions
3. Controls recovery
4. Updates metrics
5. Integrates tracing

### record_success()/record_failure()

Tracks outcomes:

1. Updates state
2. Records metrics
3. Manages recovery
4. Traces results

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient state checks
- Minimal tracing overhead
- Optimized transitions
- Fast decorator wrapping

## Security Considerations

- Protected state changes
- Safe recovery testing
- Validated transitions
- Resource protection

## Known Issues

1. Partial circuit breaking support needed
2. Request prioritization pending

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. State Machine:

   - Simple three-state vs complex states
   - Clear transitions
   - Easy understanding

2. Decorator Approach:

   - Easy integration
   - Automatic protection
   - Some flexibility loss

3. Tracing Integration:

   - Comprehensive visibility
   - Performance impact
   - Optional enabling

4. Recovery Testing:
   - Conservative approach
   - Configurable thresholds
   - Failure protection
