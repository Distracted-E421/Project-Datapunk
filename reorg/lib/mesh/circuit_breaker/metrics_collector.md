# Circuit Breaker Metrics Collector

## Purpose

Provides comprehensive metrics collection and analysis for the circuit breaker system, including performance monitoring, pattern detection, and health status reporting.

## Context

Metrics collection component of the circuit breaker system, gathering and analyzing operational data for monitoring and decision making.

## Dependencies

- structlog: For logging
- asyncio: For async operations
- statistics: For calculations
- numpy: For analysis
- collections: For data structures

## Features

- Real-time metrics collection
- Pattern detection
- Anomaly detection
- Trend analysis
- Resource utilization tracking
- Health status reporting
- Historical analysis

## Core Components

### CircuitMetricsConfig

Configuration for collection:

- Window size
- Bucket size
- Percentile tracking
- Anomaly thresholds
- Trend analysis windows

### MetricsBucket

Time-based metric storage:

- Request counts
- Error tracking
- Latency measurements
- Circuit state changes
- Resource usage

### CircuitBreakerMetricsCollector

Main metrics management:

- Data collection
- Pattern analysis
- Trend detection
- Health reporting
- Resource tracking

## Key Methods

### record_request()

Tracks request metrics:

1. Updates counters
2. Records latency
3. Checks anomalies
4. Updates patterns
5. Manages buckets

### analyze_patterns()

Performs pattern analysis:

1. Detects trends
2. Identifies anomalies
3. Updates baselines
4. Records patterns

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient data structures
- Optimized calculations
- Bounded storage
- Smart bucketing

## Security Considerations

- Protected metrics
- Validated updates
- Resource limits
- Safe analysis

## Known Issues

None documented

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. Storage Strategy:

   - Time-based buckets
   - Resolution vs space
   - Retention period

2. Analysis Depth:

   - Real-time vs batch
   - Accuracy vs overhead
   - Pattern complexity

3. Metric Selection:

   - Coverage vs impact
   - Update frequency
   - Storage requirements

4. Pattern Detection:
   - Sensitivity vs noise
   - Window size
   - Detection methods
