# Retry System

## Purpose

Provides advanced retry functionality with multiple backoff strategies, jitter support, and comprehensive monitoring for handling transient failures in distributed systems.

## Context

The retry system is a critical component for handling temporary failures and network issues, ensuring service resilience while preventing overload conditions.

## Dependencies

- Metrics Collection System
- Async Runtime Support
- Service Health Monitoring

## Key Components

### Retry Strategies

```python
class RetryStrategy(Enum):
    FIXED = "fixed"           # Fixed delay between retries
    EXPONENTIAL = "exponential"  # Exponential backoff
    LINEAR = "linear"         # Linear backoff
    RANDOM = "random"         # Random delay within range
    FIBONACCI = "fibonacci"   # Fibonacci sequence delay
```

Each strategy optimized for different failure patterns:

- FIXED: Quick transient failures
- EXPONENTIAL: Resource exhaustion
- LINEAR: Load-related failures
- RANDOM: Thundering herd prevention
- FIBONACCI: Natural progression

### Configuration

```python
@dataclass
class RetryConfig:
    max_retries: int = 3
    initial_delay: float = 1.0
    max_delay: float = 30.0
    strategy: RetryStrategy = RetryStrategy.EXPONENTIAL
    jitter: float = 0.1
    timeout: float = 60.0
    retry_on_exceptions: tuple = (Exception,)
    retry_on_status_codes: Optional[set] = None
    backoff_factor: float = 2.0
```

Parameters control:

- Retry behavior
- Delay calculation
- Timeout handling
- Error conditions

## Implementation Details

### Operation Wrapping

```python
def wrap(self, operation: Callable[..., T]) -> Callable[..., T]:
```

Features:

- Multiple retry strategies
- Timeout enforcement
- Status code checking
- Metric collection

### Delay Calculation

```python
def _calculate_delay(self, attempt: int) -> float:
```

Implements:

- Strategy-specific delay calculation
- Jitter for thundering herd prevention
- Maximum delay enforcement
- Backoff factor application

### Fibonacci Delay

```python
def _fibonacci_delay(self, attempt: int) -> float:
```

Provides:

- Natural progression delays
- Smooth backoff pattern
- Predictable scaling
- Bounded growth

## Performance Considerations

- Jitter prevents synchronized retries
- Delay calculations are O(1)
- Memory usage is constant
- Minimal overhead per retry

## Security Considerations

- Timeout validation required
- Delay bounds enforcement
- Status code validation
- Exception type validation

## Known Issues

- Recursive Fibonacci calculation
- No retry state persistence
- Manual strategy selection
- Limited failure analysis

## Future Improvements

1. Enhanced Features:

   - Retry state persistence
   - Automatic strategy selection
   - Failure pattern analysis
   - Context-aware retries

2. Performance Optimization:

   - Iterative Fibonacci calculation
   - Optimized delay computation
   - Reduced memory usage
   - Efficient metric collection

3. Monitoring Enhancements:
   - Retry pattern analytics
   - Success rate tracking
   - Latency impact analysis
   - Strategy effectiveness metrics
