# Circuit Breaker

## Purpose

Implements the circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures in the service mesh by monitoring operation success/failure rates and providing graceful service degradation.

## Context

The circuit breaker is a critical component for fault tolerance, protecting services from overload and enabling graceful degradation during failures.

## Dependencies

- Metrics Collection System
- Async Runtime Support
- Service Health Monitoring

## Key Components

### Circuit States

```python
class CircuitState(Enum):
    CLOSED = "closed"      # Normal operation
    OPEN = "open"         # Failing fast
    HALF_OPEN = "half_open"  # Testing recovery
```

State transitions:

- CLOSED → OPEN: On failure threshold exceeded
- OPEN → HALF_OPEN: After timeout period
- HALF_OPEN → CLOSED: After success threshold met
- HALF_OPEN → OPEN: On any failure

### Configuration

```python
@dataclass
class CircuitConfig:
    failure_threshold: int = 5
    success_threshold: int = 2
    timeout: float = 60.0
    window_size: int = 10
    error_rate_threshold: float = 0.5
    min_throughput: int = 5
    cooldown_factor: float = 2.0
```

Parameters control:

- Failure detection
- Recovery behavior
- Timeout periods
- Error rate monitoring

## Implementation Details

### Operation Execution

```python
async def execute(
    self,
    operation: Callable[..., T],
    *args,
    **kwargs
) -> T
```

Features:

- State-based execution control
- Success/failure tracking
- Metric collection
- Timeout management

### State Management

```python
async def _check_state_transition(self):
```

Handles:

- State transition logic
- Recovery detection
- Error rate calculation
- Timeout management

### Error Rate Monitoring

```python
def _calculate_error_rate(self) -> float:
```

Provides:

- Rolling window monitoring
- Error rate calculation
- Minimum throughput validation
- Trend detection

## Performance Considerations

- State transitions are thread-safe
- Rolling window limits memory usage
- Exponential backoff prevents thrashing
- Minimal overhead per operation

## Security Considerations

- State manipulation protection needed
- Metric data access control
- Configuration validation required
- Recovery threshold validation

## Known Issues

- Potential race condition in window updates
- No circuit state persistence
- Manual threshold tuning required
- Limited failure type differentiation

## Future Improvements

1. Enhanced Features:

   - Circuit state persistence
   - Automatic threshold adjustment
   - Failure type categorization
   - Recovery prediction

2. Performance Optimization:

   - Optimized state transitions
   - Efficient window management
   - Reduced lock contention
   - Batch metric updates

3. Monitoring Enhancements:
   - Detailed state analytics
   - Failure pattern detection
   - Recovery time prediction
   - Health score integration
