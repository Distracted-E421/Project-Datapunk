# Routing Module Overview

## Purpose

The routing module provides comprehensive traffic management and resilience features for the service mesh, including dynamic routing rules, circuit breaking, and retry mechanisms.

## Architecture

The module consists of several key components:

### Routing Rules (`rules.md`)

- Dynamic traffic routing
- Path/header/query matching
- Traffic splitting
- A/B testing support

### Circuit Breaker (`circuit.md`)

- Failure detection
- Graceful degradation
- State management
- Recovery handling

### Retry System (`retry.md`)

- Multiple retry strategies
- Backoff patterns
- Jitter support
- Timeout management

## Key Features

1. Traffic Management:

   - Dynamic routing rules
   - Traffic splitting
   - Version routing
   - Subset routing
   - A/B testing
   - Canary deployments

2. Resilience:

   - Circuit breaking
   - Automatic recovery
   - Multiple retry strategies
   - Backoff patterns
   - Failure detection
   - Health awareness

3. Monitoring:
   - Request tracking
   - Error detection
   - Performance metrics
   - Health status
   - Circuit state
   - Retry patterns

## Integration Points

1. Service Discovery:

   - Instance registration
   - Health updates
   - Metadata sync

## Configuration Examples

### Routing Rule

```python
route_rule = RouteRule(
    name="canary-deployment",
    matches=[
        RouteMatch(
            match_type=RouteMatchType.HEADER,
            pattern="x-version",
            value="v2"
        )
    ],
    destinations=[
        RouteDestination(
            service_name="my-service",
            version="v2",
            weight=20
        ),
        RouteDestination(
            service_name="my-service",
            version="v1",
            weight=80
        )
    ]
)
```

### Circuit Breaker

```python
circuit = CircuitBreaker(
    config=CircuitConfig(
        failure_threshold=5,
        success_threshold=2,
        timeout=60.0,
        error_rate_threshold=0.5
    )
)
```

### Retry Policy

```python
retry = RetryPolicy(
    config=RetryConfig(
        max_retries=3,
        strategy=RetryStrategy.EXPONENTIAL,
        initial_delay=1.0,
        jitter=0.1
    )
)
```

## Performance Considerations

- Rule evaluation overhead
- Circuit state transitions
- Retry delay calculations
- Metric collection impact
- Memory usage patterns
- Lock contention

## Security Considerations

- Rule modification auth
- Circuit state protection
- Retry bound enforcement
- Metric data access
- Configuration validation
- State manipulation

## Known Issues

- Rule conflict detection
- Circuit state persistence
- Retry state persistence
- Manual configuration
- Limited analytics
- Race conditions

## Future Improvements

   - Automatic rule generation
   - ML-based circuit breaking
   - Context-aware retries
   - Advanced analytics

2. Performance Optimization:

   - Rule caching
   - State management
   - Lock reduction
   - Memory efficiency

3. Monitoring Enhancements:
