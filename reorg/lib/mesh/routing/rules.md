# Routing Rules

## Purpose

Defines the dynamic routing rule system for the service mesh, enabling sophisticated traffic management through configurable routing patterns and traffic splitting.

## Context

The routing rules system forms the core traffic management layer of the service mesh, allowing fine-grained control over request routing based on multiple criteria.

## Dependencies

- Service Discovery Registry
- Logging System
- Traffic Management System

## Key Components

### Route Match Types

```python
class RouteMatchType(Enum):
    PATH = "path"
    HEADER = "header"
    QUERY = "query"
    METHOD = "method"
```

Supports multiple matching criteria:

- Path-based routing with regex support
- Header-based routing for A/B testing
- Query parameter routing
- HTTP method routing

### Route Configuration

```python
@dataclass
class RouteMatch:
    match_type: RouteMatchType
    pattern: str
    value: Optional[str] = None
    regex: Optional[Pattern] = None
```

```python
@dataclass
class RouteDestination:
    service_name: str
    weight: int = 100
    version: Optional[str] = None
    subset: Optional[str] = None
```

### Rule Management

```python
@dataclass
class RouteRule:
    name: str
    matches: List[RouteMatch]
    destinations: List[RouteDestination]
    priority: int = 0
    enabled: bool = True
```

## Implementation Details

### Rule Evaluation

```python
async def get_destinations(
    self,
    path: str,
    headers: Dict[str, str],
    method: str,
    query_params: Dict[str, str]
) -> List[RouteDestination]
```

- Evaluates rules in priority order
- Supports multiple match conditions
- Returns weighted destinations
- Handles rule disablement

### Traffic Splitting

```python
async def select_destination(
    self,
    destinations: List[RouteDestination]
) -> Optional[RouteDestination]
```

Features:

- Percentage-based traffic splitting
- Gradual rollout support
- A/B testing capability
- Canary deployment support

## Performance Considerations

- Rule evaluation is O(n) with number of rules
- Regex compilation done at initialization
- Priority-based early exit optimization
- Efficient weight normalization

## Security Considerations

- Header validation required
- Path pattern sanitization needed
- Rule modification should be authenticated
- Traffic splitting manipulation protection

## Known Issues

- No rule conflict detection
- Regex patterns may be resource intensive
- Manual weight normalization required
- Limited rule validation

## Future Improvements

1. Rule Management:

   - Automatic rule conflict detection
   - Rule validation framework
   - Rule versioning support
   - Rule audit logging

2. Traffic Management:

   - Automatic weight balancing
   - Dynamic rule adjustment
   - Rule analytics and insights
   - Rule template system

3. Performance:
   - Rule caching
   - Optimized regex matching
   - Batch rule updates
   - Rule precompilation
