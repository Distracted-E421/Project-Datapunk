## Purpose

This module implements a comprehensive alert management system that handles alert rules, notifications, and lifecycle management for the monitoring system. It provides a flexible framework for defining, triggering, and managing alerts with different severity levels and notification channels.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Alert Enums** [Lines: 11-23]

   - `AlertSeverity`: Defines alert priority levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO)
   - `AlertStatus`: Tracks alert lifecycle states (ACTIVE, ACKNOWLEDGED, RESOLVED, EXPIRED)

2. **Data Models** [Lines: 24-45]

   - `AlertRule`: Defines alert conditions and metadata
   - `Alert`: Represents an active alert instance with tracking information

3. **Notification System** [Lines: 47-63]

   - Abstract `NotificationChannel` base class
   - Concrete implementations for Email and Slack notifications
   - Extensible design for adding new notification channels

4. **Alert Manager** [Lines: 65-237]
   - Central alert management class
   - Handles rule registration and monitoring
   - Manages alert lifecycle and notifications
   - Provides async operation support

### Key Features

1. **Rule Management** [Lines: 76-90]

   - Dynamic rule registration and removal
   - Validation of rule uniqueness
   - Async task management for rule checking

2. **Notification System** [Lines: 91-110]

   - Multiple notification channels per severity level
   - Support for adding/removing channels
   - Async notification dispatch

3. **Alert Lifecycle** [Lines: 188-227]
   - Alert acknowledgment support
   - Resolution tracking
   - Audit trail for alert changes

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- `asyncio`: Async operation support
- `logging`: Logging functionality
- `dataclasses`: Data model definitions
- `abc`: Abstract base class support
- `enum`: Enumeration support
- `typing`: Type hint support
- `datetime`: Timestamp handling

### Internal Modules

None directly imported

## Known Issues

1. **TODO Items** [Lines: 52-57]
   - Email notification implementation pending
   - Slack notification implementation pending

## Performance Considerations

1. **Async Design** [Lines: 111-146]

   - Uses asyncio for non-blocking operations
   - Implements timeouts for rule checking
   - Handles concurrent notification dispatch

2. **Resource Management** [Lines: 174-187]
   - Proper task cleanup on shutdown
   - Cancellation of running checks

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**

   - Alert acknowledgment requires user identification
   - Resolution tracking includes user attribution

2. **Validation**
   - Rule name uniqueness enforced
   - Status transitions validated

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Async Architecture**

   - **Decision**: Use asyncio for core operations
   - **Rationale**: Enables efficient handling of multiple rules and notifications
   - **Trade-off**: Increased complexity vs better scalability

2. **Notification System**

   - **Decision**: Abstract base class with concrete implementations
   - **Rationale**: Allows easy addition of new notification channels
   - **Trade-off**: Additional abstraction vs extensibility

3. **Alert Lifecycle**
   - **Decision**: Implement full lifecycle tracking
   - **Rationale**: Provides audit trail and state management
   - **Trade-off**: Memory usage vs tracking capability
