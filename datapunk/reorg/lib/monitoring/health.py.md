## Purpose

This module implements a flexible health check system designed for Datapunk's microservices architecture. It provides real-time monitoring of service dependencies with support for degraded states, tracing integration, and aggregated health reporting.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Module Documentation** [Lines: 10-32]

   - Comprehensive system overview
   - Key features and design philosophy
   - Implementation notes and TODOs

2. **Health Status Enum** [Lines: 34-48]

   - Three-state health tracking (HEALTHY, DEGRADED, UNHEALTHY)
   - Supports nuanced status reporting
   - Enables graceful degradation handling

3. **Health Check Class** [Lines: 50-165]
   - Main health check implementation
   - Dependency management
   - Status aggregation
   - Tracing integration

### Key Features

1. **Dependency Checking** [Lines: 71-94]

   - HTTP-based health checks
   - Configurable timeouts
   - Error handling and logging
   - Status code validation

2. **Health Aggregation** [Lines: 96-140]

   - Comprehensive status calculation
   - Tracing instrumentation
   - Detailed result reporting
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Dynamic Configuration** [Lines: 142-165]
   - Runtime check addition
   - Status property access
   - Performance warning system

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- `asyncio`: Async operation support
- `aiohttp`: HTTP client for health checks
- `structlog`: Structured logging
- `enum`: Enumeration support
- `typing`: Type hint support

### Internal Modules

- `..tracing`: Tracing functionality for monitoring

## Known Issues

1. **TODO Items**

   - Custom health check protocols support needed [Line: 31]
   - Custom health criteria per dependency [Line: 79]

2. **FIXME Items**
   - Consider adding async health check execution support [Line: 60]

## Performance Considerations

1. **HTTP Checks** [Lines: 71-94]

   - Implements timeouts to prevent hanging
   - Uses connection pooling via aiohttp
   - Handles connection failures gracefully

2. **Aggregation** [Lines: 96-140]

   - Concurrent check execution
   - Performance tracing integration
   - Efficient status calculation

3. **Resource Management** [Lines: 142-152]
   - Warning about check count impact
   - Dynamic check configuration

## Security Considerations

1. **Error Handling**

   - Sanitized error messages in responses
   - Detailed logging for debugging
   - Secure error propagation

2. **HTTP Security**
   - Uses HTTPS (implicit in URLs)
   - Timeout protection
   - Status code validation

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Three-State Health Model**

   - **Decision**: Include DEGRADED state
   - **Rationale**: Enables nuanced service health reporting
   - **Trade-off**: Added complexity vs better status granularity

2. **HTTP-Based Checks**

   - **Decision**: Use HTTP as primary check mechanism
   - **Rationale**: Universal protocol support, simple implementation
   - **Trade-off**: Limited protocol support vs broad compatibility

3. **Tracing Integration**

   - **Decision**: Built-in tracing support
   - **Rationale**: Enables detailed performance monitoring
   - **Trade-off**: Overhead vs observability

4. **Dynamic Configuration**
   - **Decision**: Runtime check configuration
   - **Rationale**: Flexible dependency management
   - **Trade-off**: Potential performance impact vs flexibility
