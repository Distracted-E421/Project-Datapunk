## Purpose

Provides a robust retry mechanism for handling transient failures in distributed systems. Implements exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems during service recovery scenarios. This is a critical reliability component used throughout the system.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **RetryConfig** [Lines: 31-48]

   - Dataclass for configuring retry behavior
   - Configurable parameters for max attempts, delays, and backoff strategy
   - Default values balanced for quick recovery and system stability
   - Supports exponential backoff and jitter for preventing retry storms

2. **with_retry Decorator** [Lines: 49-117]
   - Main decorator implementing retry logic
   - Handles async functions with exponential backoff
   - Provides structured logging of retry attempts
   - Implements configurable exception handling

### Key Features

1. **Exponential Backoff** [Lines: 94-101]

   - Base delay multiplied exponentially with each attempt
   - Optional jitter to prevent synchronized retries
   - Configurable maximum delay cap
   - Randomized jitter up to 10%

2. **Structured Logging** [Lines: 85-90, 103-109]
   - Detailed error logging with context
   - Tracks function name, attempt number, and error details
   - Different log levels for final failure vs retry attempts

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- typing: Type hints for better code maintainability [Line: 24]
- asyncio: Async/await support for non-blocking retries [Line: 25]
- dataclasses: Configuration data structure [Line: 26]
- structlog: Structured logging functionality [Line: 27]

## Known Issues

1. **Code Organization** [Lines: 94-95]

   - FIXME: Delay calculation logic needs to be moved to a separate method
   - Impact: Code maintainability and testability

2. **Missing Features** [Lines: 61-62]
   - TODO: Circuit breaker integration needed
   - TODO: Retry budgets for system-wide retry management

## Performance Considerations

1. **Delay Calculation** [Lines: 96-101]

   - Exponential growth capped at max_delay
   - Jitter adds up to 10% randomization
   - Impact: Prevents system overload during recovery

2. **Async Implementation** [Lines: 72-114]
   - Non-blocking retry mechanism
   - Uses asyncio.sleep for delays
   - Suitable for high-concurrency environments

## Security Considerations

1. **Exception Handling** [Lines: 79-91]
   - Configurable exception types for retry
   - Proper error propagation after max attempts
   - Prevents infinite retry loops

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Default Configuration**

   - **Decision**: 3 retry attempts with 1s base delay [Lines: 43-44]
   - **Rationale**: Balance between persistence and fail-fast
   - **Trade-off**: May not be optimal for all use cases

2. **Jitter Implementation**
   - **Decision**: Up to 10% random jitter [Lines: 98-100]
   - **Rationale**: Prevents thundering herd while maintaining predictable bounds
   - **Trade-off**: Slightly less predictable retry timing

## Future Improvements

1. **Circuit Breaker** [Line: 61]

   - Integration with circuit breaker pattern
   - Prevent unnecessary retries during systemic failures

2. **Retry Budgets** [Line: 62]
   - System-wide retry management
   - Prevent retry amplification in cascading failures
