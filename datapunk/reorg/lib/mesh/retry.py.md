## Purpose

The `retry.py` module implements a resilient retry mechanism for the service mesh layer, providing advanced retry policies with exponential backoff, metrics collection, and distributed tracing integration.

## Implementation

- **Core Classes**:

  1. `RetryConfig` (lines 28-44)

     - Configuration for retry behavior
     - Customizable per service with reasonable defaults
     - Implements exponential backoff with jitter

  2. `RetryPolicy` (lines 45-161)

     - Implements core retry logic
     - Provides metrics and tracing integration
     - Handles exponential backoff calculation

  3. `EnhancedRetryPolicy` (lines 187-220)
     - Extends base retry policy
     - Adds Redis-backed resilience features
     - Implements distributed state management

### Key Components

1. **Retry Configuration** (lines 28-44):

   - Maximum attempts control
   - Configurable delays and backoff
   - Jitter for thundering herd prevention
   - Timeout management

2. **Core Retry Logic** (lines 82-161):

   - Progressive backoff implementation
   - Detailed metric collection
   - Distributed tracing integration
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. **Retry Decorator** (lines 163-185):
   - Provides easy retry integration
   - Configurable retry conditions
   - Service-specific configurations
   - Operation tracking

## Location

Located in `datapunk/lib/mesh/retry.py`, providing retry functionality for the service mesh.

## Integration

- Integrates with:
  - Metrics system for monitoring
  - Tracing system for observability
  - Redis for distributed state
  - Circuit breaker for fault tolerance
  - Service mesh for coordination

## Dependencies

- External:

  - `structlog`: For structured logging
  - `asyncio`: For async operations
  - `random`: For jitter calculation
  - `time`: For timing operations
  - `dataclasses`: For configuration

- Internal:
  - `.metrics`: For retry metrics
  - `..tracing`: For distributed tracing

## Known Issues

1. Circuit breaker integration needed (TODO in line 54)
2. Retry budget implementation needed (FIXME in line 55)
3. Retry budget sharing across instances needed (TODO in line 196)

## Refactoring Notes

1. Implement retry budget mechanism
2. Add circuit breaker integration
3. Optimize Redis-backed state management
4. Add retry quota management
5. Implement adaptive retry policies
6. Add support for custom retry strategies
