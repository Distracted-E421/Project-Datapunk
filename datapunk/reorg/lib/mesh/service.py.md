## Purpose

The `service.py` module provides service management functionality within the mesh, handling service registration, discovery, and load balancing integration.

## Implementation

- **Core Classes**:

  1. `ServiceConfig` (lines 26-40)

     - Data class for service instance configuration
     - Encapsulates registration details and health check parameters

  2. `ServiceMesh` (lines 42-235)
     - Manages service lifecycle and load balancing
     - Handles registration, deregistration, and health monitoring

### Key Components

1. **Service Registration** (lines 78-131):

   - Handles service registration with Consul
   - Configures health checks
   - Integrates with load balancer
   - Implements error handling and logging

2. **Service Deregistration** (lines 133-152):

   - Cleans up service registrations
   - Removes load balancer instances
   - Handles error cases

3. **Service Discovery** (lines 154-172):

   - Retrieves service details from Consul
   - Implements caching for performance
   - Returns healthy service instances

4. **Health Monitoring** (lines 174-190):
   - Tracks service health status
   - Updates load balancer with health information
   - Implements service instance tracking

## Location

Located in `datapunk/lib/mesh/service.py`, providing service management functionality.

## Integration

- Integrates with:
  - Consul for service registration
  - Load balancer for request distribution
  - Health check system for monitoring
  - Metrics collection for performance tracking
  - Caching system for optimization

## Dependencies

- External:

  - `consul`: For service registration and discovery
  - `structlog`: For structured logging
  - `socket`: For network operations
  - `json`: For data serialization
  - `dataclasses`: For data structures

- Internal:
  - `.load_balancer.load_balancer`: For request distribution
  - `.tracing`: For distributed tracing

## Known Issues

1. Edge cases where Consul registration partially succeeds (FIXME in line 90)
2. Cache may serve stale data briefly (WARNING in line 76)
3. Need to optimize for large-scale deployments (TODO in line 161)

## Refactoring Notes

1. Implement cache invalidation strategy
2. Add support for custom health check endpoints
3. Optimize service discovery for large deployments
4. Add circuit breaker integration
5. Implement retry budget for better reliability
6. Consider adding support for additional service registries
