# Health Check Aggregator

## Purpose

Aggregates and manages multiple health check results across service components in the Datapunk service mesh, providing a unified view of service health for routing decisions and service discovery.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **HealthAggregator** [Lines: 29-182]
   - Main aggregation manager
   - Maintains check registry
   - Executes concurrent checks
   - Caches results
   - Determines overall status

### Key Features

1. **Check Management** [Lines: 71-83]

   - Registration and removal of checks
   - Unique check naming
   - Atomic check design
   - Independent execution

2. **Health Aggregation** [Lines: 85-142]

   - Cache-first approach
   - Concurrent check execution
   - Status determination rules
   - Result aggregation
   - Error handling

3. **Result Caching** [Lines: 154-182]
   - TTL-based caching
   - Failure caching
   - Cache invalidation
   - Performance optimization

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- `.health_check_types`: Core health types [Lines: 5-9]
  - HealthStatus
  - HealthCheckResult
  - BaseHealthCheck

### External Dependencies

- `structlog`: Structured logging [Line: 2]
- `asyncio`: Async operations [Line: 3]
- `datetime`: Time handling [Line: 4]

## Known Issues

1. **Cache Memory** [Line: 20]

   - High memory usage with many checks
   - Needs optimization for large deployments

2. **Check Priorities** [Line: 48]

   - Missing priority support
   - All checks treated equally

3. **Partial Results** [Line: 171]
   - No support for partial check results
   - Binary success/failure only

## Performance Considerations

1. **Caching Strategy** [Lines: 85-142]

   - TTL-based caching reduces check frequency
   - Cache-first approach minimizes resource usage
   - Configurable TTL for balance
   - Concurrent check execution

2. **Error Handling** [Lines: 154-182]
   - Failed check caching prevents retry storms
   - Error isolation
   - Graceful degradation
   - Logged failures

## Security Considerations

1. **Check Isolation** [Lines: 154-182]

   - Independent check execution
   - Error containment
   - Failure logging
   - No cross-check contamination

2. **Status Determination** [Lines: 85-142]
   - Conservative status approach
   - Any unhealthy check fails service
   - Degraded state for partial issues
   - Clear failure conditions

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Caching Approach**

   - **Decision**: TTL-based caching with cache-first strategy [Lines: 85-142]
   - **Rationale**: Balance freshness and performance
   - **Trade-off**: Staleness vs resource usage

2. **Status Determination**

   - **Decision**: Conservative failure model [Lines: 124-127]
   - **Rationale**: Prioritize reliability over availability
   - **Trade-off**: Availability vs consistency

3. **Check Execution**

   - **Decision**: Concurrent execution with isolation [Lines: 154-182]
   - **Rationale**: Maximize throughput while containing failures
   - **Trade-off**: Resource usage vs speed

4. **Error Handling**
   - **Decision**: Cache failures with logging [Lines: 176-182]
   - **Rationale**: Prevent retry storms while maintaining visibility
   - **Trade-off**: Recovery speed vs system stability
