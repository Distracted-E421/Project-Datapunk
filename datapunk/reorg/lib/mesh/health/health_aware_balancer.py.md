# Health-Aware Load Balancer

## Purpose

Provides intelligent load balancing with health-based instance selection, circuit breaking for fault isolation, and gradual recovery mechanisms to ensure reliable service routing in the Datapunk service mesh.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **HealthAwareConfig** [Lines: 29-49]

   - Configuration for load balancing behavior
   - Tunable thresholds and intervals
   - Recovery parameters
   - Circuit breaker settings

2. **HealthAwareLoadBalancer** [Lines: 51-255]
   - Main load balancer implementation
   - Health score tracking
   - Circuit breaker management
   - Instance selection
   - Health monitoring

### Key Features

1. **Instance Selection** [Lines: 90-142]

   - Health-based filtering
   - Minimum healthy instance enforcement
   - Strategy-based selection
   - Metric recording

2. **Health Management** [Lines: 144-202]

   - Health score tracking
   - Success/failure recording
   - Circuit breaker control
   - Gradual recovery

3. **Health Monitoring** [Lines: 204-255]
   - Continuous health checks
   - Score updates
   - Circuit breaker management
   - Recovery window enforcement

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- `..load_balancer.load_balancer_strategies`: Load balancing strategy types [Line: 6]
- `.health_checks`: Health checking functionality [Line: 7]
- `..monitoring`: Metrics collection [Line: 8]

### External Dependencies

- `structlog`: Structured logging [Line: 2]
- `asyncio`: Async operations [Line: 3]
- `datetime`: Time handling [Line: 5]

## Known Issues

1. **Memory Usage** [Line: 23]

   - High memory usage with large instance sets
   - Needs optimization for scale

2. **Health Scoring** [Line: 69]

   - Score calculation needs improvement for burst errors
   - Basic implementation

3. **Health Checks** [Line: 214]
   - Missing backoff for failing checks
   - Potential resource waste

## Performance Considerations

1. **Instance Selection** [Lines: 90-142]

   - Efficient filtering
   - Cached health scores
   - Strategy-based selection
   - Error isolation

2. **Health Management** [Lines: 144-202]
   - Quick degradation on errors
   - Gradual recovery
   - Circuit breaking
   - Metric batching

## Security Considerations

1. **Circuit Breaking** [Lines: 144-202]

   - Automatic fault isolation
   - Configurable thresholds
   - Recovery windows
   - Failure tracking

2. **Health Checks** [Lines: 204-255]
   - Isolated check execution
   - Error containment
   - Logged failures
   - Recovery controls

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Health Scoring**

   - **Decision**: Asymmetric score adjustment [Lines: 154-202]
   - **Rationale**: Quick failure detection, gradual recovery
   - **Trade-off**: Responsiveness vs stability

2. **Circuit Breaking**

   - **Decision**: Threshold-based with recovery window [Lines: 144-202]
   - **Rationale**: Prevent cascading failures
   - **Trade-off**: Availability vs reliability

3. **Instance Selection**

   - **Decision**: Health-filtered strategy delegation [Lines: 90-142]
   - **Rationale**: Combine health awareness with flexible balancing
   - **Trade-off**: Complexity vs flexibility

4. **Recovery Mechanism**
   - **Decision**: Time-windowed gradual recovery [Lines: 238-255]
   - **Rationale**: Prevent premature recovery and flapping
   - **Trade-off**: Recovery speed vs stability
