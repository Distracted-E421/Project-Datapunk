- `random`: Selection randomization [Line: 3]
- `time`: Performance tracking [Line: 4]

## Known Issues

1. **Strategy Switching** [Line: 21]

   - Performance impact with large instance sets
   - Optimization needed

2. **Health Scoring** [Line: 20]

   - Missing predictive scoring
   - Basic implementation

3. **Service Configuration** [Line: 37]
   - Missing per-service configuration
   - Global settings only

## Performance Considerations

1. **Round-Robin Strategy** [Lines: 48-119]

   - O(1) selection time
   - Minimal computation
   - Simple state tracking
   - Efficient metric recording

2. **Least Connections** [Lines: 120-191]

   - O(n) selection time
   - Score calculation overhead
   - Connection tracking
   - Combined metrics

3. **Adaptive Strategy** [Lines: 193-284]
   - O(n) selection time
   - Trend analysis overhead
   - State maintenance
   - Recovery detection

## Security Considerations

1. **Instance Selection** [Lines: 72-119]

   - Health validation
   - Metric recording
   - Error handling
   - Safe defaults

2. **Health Tracking** [Lines: 193-284]
   - Failure isolation
   - Recovery validation
   - Error containment
   - Safe state transitions

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Strategy Types**

   - **Decision**: Multiple strategy implementations [Lines: 48-284]
   - **Rationale**: Support different use cases and requirements
   - **Trade-off**: Complexity vs flexibility

2. **Health Weighting**

   - **Decision**: Combined score approach [Lines: 169-172]
   - **Rationale**: Balance health and load considerations
   - **Trade-off**: Accuracy vs simplicity

3. **Recovery Handling**

   - **Decision**: Explicit recovery preference [Lines: 259-268]
   - **Rationale**: Promote service stability
   - **Trade-off**: Recovery speed vs load balance

4. **Metric Integration**
   - **Decision**: Comprehensive metric recording [Lines: 105-118, 177-190, 271-284]
   - **Rationale**: Enable behavior analysis and optimization
   - **Trade-off**: Performance impact vs observability
