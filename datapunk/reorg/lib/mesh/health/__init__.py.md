# Health Module Initialization

## Purpose

Initializes the health monitoring module for the Datapunk service mesh, providing a central entry point for health checking, monitoring, and reporting functionality.

## Implementation

This is a simple initialization file that serves as the package entry point for the health module. It enables importing of health-related functionality from other modules in the package.

### Core Components

The module acts as a namespace package, allowing:

- Clean organization of health monitoring code
- Modular imports of health functionality
- Package-level initialization

## Dependencies

No direct dependencies as this is a simple initialization file.

## Known Issues

None identified.

## Performance Considerations

None, as this is a basic initialization file.

## Security Considerations

None directly in the initialization file.

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

The module uses a minimal initialization approach to:

- Keep the package structure clean
- Enable modular imports
- Maintain separation of concerns
