# Threat Detection System

## Purpose

Implements a real-time threat detection and response system for the Datapunk service mesh, using rule-based detection and pattern analysis to identify and automatically respond to security threats. The system provides IP-based blocking, automatic threat response, and security event correlation with performance-optimized tracking.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **ThreatLevel Enum** [Lines: 29-41]

   - Defines standardized threat severity levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
   - Each level triggers increasingly aggressive protective measures
   - Used for consistent response handling across the mesh

2. **ThreatRule Class** [Lines: 42-59]

   - Configures detection rules with thresholds and response parameters
   - Balances detection accuracy with memory usage through time windows
   - Includes cooldown periods for threat mitigation

3. **ThreatEvent Class** [Lines: 61-74]

   - Contains security event data for analysis
   - Captures comprehensive threat context
   - Supports both real-time and historical analysis

4. **ThreatDetector Class** [Lines: 75-243]
   - Coordinates threat detection and response
   - Implements memory-efficient event tracking
   - Handles automatic cleanup to prevent resource exhaustion

### Key Features

1. **Event Processing** [Lines: 131-164]

   - Analyzes events against detection rules
   - Implements cooldown mechanism for blocked IPs
   - Maintains event tracking with automatic expiration

2. **Rule Checking** [Lines: 166-188]

   - Evaluates events against configured threat rules
   - Uses time-windowed event counting
   - Returns highest detected threat level

3. **Threat Handling** [Lines: 190-227]

   - Implements automatic IP blocking for high/critical threats
   - Integrates with audit logging system
   - Updates security metrics for monitoring

4. **Event Cleanup** [Lines: 228-243]
   - Automatically removes expired events
   - Uses longest rule window for cleanup timing
   - Prevents memory leaks from old events

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- typing: Type hints for code clarity [Line: 1]
- time: Timestamp management [Line: 2]
- asyncio: Asynchronous operations [Line: 3]
- logging: Error and event logging [Line: 4]
- dataclasses: Data structure definitions [Line: 5]
- enum: Enumeration support [Line: 6]
- datetime: Time calculations [Line: 7]
- collections: defaultdict for event tracking [Line: 8]

### Internal Modules

- security_metrics: Metrics collection integration [Line: 9]
- security_audit: Audit logging system [Line: 10]

## Known Issues

1. **TODO Items**
   - Custom response actions support needed [Line: 51]
   - Machine learning-based thresholds planned [Line: 52]

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Management** [Lines: 228-243]

   - Implements automatic event cleanup
   - Uses time windows for efficient memory usage
   - Removes empty IP entries to prevent memory bloat

2. **Event Processing** [Lines: 131-164]
   - Continues processing despite metric/audit failures
   - Uses efficient data structures for event tracking
   - Implements IP-based indexing for quick lookups

## Security Considerations

1. **Threat Response** [Lines: 190-227]

   - Automatic IP blocking for severe threats
   - Configurable cooldown periods
   - Integration with audit logging

2. **Rule Configuration** [Lines: 107-129]
   - Tuned thresholds for common attack patterns
   - Different time windows for various threat types
   - Graduated response based on threat severity

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Memory vs. Detection Accuracy**

   - **Decision**: Use time-windowed event tracking [Lines: 228-243]
   - **Rationale**: Balances memory usage with detection capability
   - **Trade-off**: Older events are discarded, potentially missing long-term patterns

2. **Response Automation**

   - **Decision**: Automatic IP blocking for high/critical threats [Lines: 194-200]
   - **Rationale**: Immediate response to serious security threats
   - **Trade-off**: Potential false positives affecting legitimate traffic

3. **Rule Configuration**
   - **Decision**: Pre-configured rules for common attacks [Lines: 107-129]
   - **Rationale**: Immediate protection without manual configuration
   - **Trade-off**: May not cover all specific use cases

## Future Improvements

1. **Machine Learning Integration** [Line: 52]

   - Add ML-based threshold determination
   - Implement pattern recognition
   - Automate rule generation

2. **Custom Response Actions** [Line: 51]
   - Support service-specific responses
   - Add configurable action chains
   - Implement response templates
