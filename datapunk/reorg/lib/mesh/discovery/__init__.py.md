# Discovery Module Initialization

## Purpose

Initializes the discovery module which provides service discovery, registration, and synchronization capabilities for the Datapunk service mesh.

## Implementation

The module serves as the entry point for the discovery package, organizing related functionality across multiple submodules:

- `dns_resolver.py`: DNS-based service discovery
- `metadata.py`: Service metadata management
- `registry.py`: Service registration and tracking
- `resolution.py`: Service instance resolution
- `sync.py`: Registry synchronization

## Dependencies

No direct dependencies as this is an initialization file.

## Known Issues

None identified.

## Performance Considerations

None, as this is a simple initialization file.

## Security Considerations

None directly in the initialization file.

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

The module structure separates concerns into distinct files for better maintainability and clarity:

- DNS resolution is isolated from general service resolution
- Metadata management is independent of service registration
- Synchronization logic is separated from core registry functionality
