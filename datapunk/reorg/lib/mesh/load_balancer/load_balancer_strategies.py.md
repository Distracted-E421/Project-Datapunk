## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- `.load_balancer_metrics`: Metrics collection [Line: 7]

### External Dependencies

- `random`: Selection randomization [Line: 2]
- `time`: Timing operations [Line: 3]

## Known Issues

1. **Weight Bias** [Line: 69]

   - Bias towards higher weights
   - Rebalancing issues
   - Implementation limitation

2. **Health Threshold** [Line: 48]

   - Static threshold value
   - No per-service configuration
   - Basic implementation

3. **Strategy Thresholds** [Line: 177]
   - Static thresholds
   - Missing historical analysis
   - Configuration needs

## Performance Considerations

1. **Weight Management** [Lines: 52-101]

   - O(n) weight updates
   - Memory for weight tracking
   - Service map overhead
   - Update frequency

2. **Instance Selection** [Lines: 103-149]

   - O(1) power of two
   - O(n) least connections
   - Memory vs speed
   - Health filtering cost

3. **Strategy Switching** [Lines: 151-239]
   - Variance calculation cost
   - Strategy initialization
   - Metric recording
   - Memory usage

## Security Considerations

1. **Instance Data** [Lines: 14-24]

   - Metadata validation
   - Connection tracking
   - Health score integrity
   - Weight validation

2. **Strategy Selection** [Lines: 151-239]
   - Load information exposure
   - Strategy visibility
   - Metric security
   - Error handling

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Health Filtering**

   - **Decision**: Static 0.5 threshold [Lines: 43-50]
   - **Rationale**: Balance availability and health
   - **Trade-off**: Flexibility vs simplicity

2. **Strategy Types**

   - **Decision**: Multiple strategy implementations [Lines: 52-149]
   - **Rationale**: Support different use cases
   - **Trade-off**: Complexity vs adaptability

3. **Load Scoring**

   - **Decision**: Health-weighted scores [Lines: 103-122]
   - **Rationale**: Balance load and health
   - **Trade-off**: Accuracy vs performance

4. **Adaptive Switching**
   - **Decision**: Threshold-based adaptation [Lines: 151-239]
   - **Rationale**: Dynamic optimization
   - **Trade-off**: Stability vs responsiveness
