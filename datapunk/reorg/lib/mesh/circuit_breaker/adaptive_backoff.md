# Adaptive Backoff System

## Purpose

Provides an intelligent backoff system that dynamically adapts retry delays based on system conditions, failure patterns, and resource utilization. The system supports multiple backoff strategies and automatically selects the most effective one based on observed behavior.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **BackoffStrategy Enum** [Lines: 19-26]

   - Defines available backoff strategies:
     - EXPONENTIAL: Standard exponential backoff
     - FIBONACCI: Fibonacci sequence-based delays
     - DECORRELATED_JITTER: Random jitter-based delays
     - RESOURCE_SENSITIVE: Resource-aware delays
     - PATTERN_BASED: Pattern-matching based delays
     - ADAPTIVE: Combined strategy approach

2. **BackoffConfig** [Lines: 28-35]

   - Configuration parameters:
     - initial_delay: Starting delay duration
     - max_delay: Maximum allowed delay
     - multiplier: Exponential growth factor
     - jitter: Randomization factor
     - pattern_window: Analysis window size
     - resource_threshold: Resource utilization limit

3. **BackoffState** [Lines: 37-48]

   - Tracks state for each backoff sequence:
     - Attempt counts
     - Delay history
     - Success/failure outcomes
     - Resource utilization states

4. **AdaptiveBackoff Class** [Lines: 50-250]
   - Main implementation with features:
     - Dynamic strategy selection
     - Pattern detection
     - Resource awareness
     - Effectiveness tracking
     - Multiple delay calculation methods

### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Strategy Selection** [Lines: 140-168]

   - Selects optimal strategy based on:
     - Resource utilization
     - Pattern detection
     - Historical effectiveness
     - Current system state

2. **Delay Calculation** [Lines: 170-223]

   - Implements multiple calculation methods:
     - Exponential backoff
     - Fibonacci sequence
     - Decorrelated jitter
     - Resource-sensitive scaling
     - Pattern-based intervals
     - Adaptive combination

3. **Pattern Detection** [Lines: 225-250]
   - Analyzes failure/success sequences
   - Identifies repeating patterns
   - Calculates optimal intervals
   - Adapts to observed behavior

## Dependencies

- typing: Type hints and annotations
- datetime: Time-based operations
- dataclasses: Configuration structure
- asyncio: Asynchronous operations
- random: Jitter implementation
- structlog: Logging functionality
- enum: Strategy enumeration
- math: Mathematical operations

## Known Issues

- Pattern detection requires minimum history (5 attempts)
- Resource-sensitive strategy depends on accurate utilization metrics
- Potential memory growth with long-running backoff sequences

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Usage**

   - Stores history for pattern detection
   - Maintains state per backoff sequence
   - Tracks strategy effectiveness

2. **Computational Overhead**
   - Pattern detection complexity
   - Multiple strategy calculations
   - Effectiveness tracking

## Security Considerations

1. **Resource Protection**

   - Prevents resource exhaustion
   - Adapts to system load
   - Manages retry attempts

2. **DoS Prevention**
   - Enforces maximum delays
   - Scales with resource pressure
   - Limits retry frequency

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Multiple Strategies**

   - **Decision**: Implement multiple backoff strategies
   - **Rationale**: Different scenarios require different approaches
   - **Trade-off**: Increased complexity vs. adaptability

2. **Pattern Detection**

   - **Decision**: Include pattern-based adaptation
   - **Rationale**: Optimize for recurring failure patterns
   - **Trade-off**: Memory usage vs. pattern recognition

3. **Resource Awareness**

   - **Decision**: Include resource-sensitive strategy
   - **Rationale**: Prevent system overload
   - **Trade-off**: Additional monitoring overhead vs. protection

4. **State Tracking**
   - **Decision**: Maintain per-sequence state
   - **Rationale**: Enable targeted adaptation
   - **Trade-off**: Memory usage vs. precision
