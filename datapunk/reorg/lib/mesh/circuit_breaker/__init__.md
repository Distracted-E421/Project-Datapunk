# Circuit Breaker Module Initialization

## Purpose

Initializes the circuit breaker module and defines its public interface. This module serves as the entry point for the circuit breaker functionality in the Datapunk service mesh.

## Implementation

The module is located at `datapunk/lib/shared/datapunk_shared/mesh/circuit_breaker/__init__.py` and provides initialization and export functionality for the circuit breaker components.

### Core Components

1. **Module Path** [Line: 1]
   - Defines the module's location in the shared library structure
   - Ensures proper import resolution within the service mesh

## Dependencies

- Part of the `datapunk_shared` package structure
- Located within the mesh infrastructure components

## Known Issues

- None documented

## Performance Considerations

- Minimal impact as this is primarily an initialization file
- No significant initialization overhead

## Security Considerations

- No direct security implications
- Part of the internal module structure

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Module Organization**
   - **Decision**: Place in shared library structure
   - **Rationale**: Enables reuse across service mesh components
   - **Trade-off**: Requires consistent versioning across services
