## Purpose

The API Key Management System provides a comprehensive framework for managing API keys in enterprise applications. It implements security best practices, compliance requirements, and flexible key lifecycle management while maintaining a clean, modular architecture.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Key Management** [Lines: 28-29]

   - Core CRUD operations via `APIKeyManager`
   - Lifecycle management and state tracking
   - Secure key storage and retrieval

2. **Policy Framework** [Lines: 31-37]

   - Security controls and access policies
   - Resource quota management
   - Compliance requirement enforcement
   - Time-based access controls

3. **Key Rotation** [Lines: 39-41]

   - Automated rotation based on policies
   - Manual rotation capabilities
   - Configurable rotation strategies

4. **Validation System** [Lines: 43-44]

   - Real-time key validation
   - Policy compliance verification
   - Configuration-based validation rules

5. **Notification System** [Lines: 46-50]

   - Multi-channel event notifications
   - Priority-based routing
   - Event type categorization

6. **Type System** [Lines: 52-53]
   - Core type definitions
   - Type safety for key operations
   - Validation result types

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- `typing`: Type hints and annotations [Line: 26]

### Internal Dependencies

- `monitoring.MetricsClient`: Performance monitoring [Line: 57]
- `cache.CacheClient`: Key storage and caching [Line: 58]
- `messaging.MessageBroker`: Event distribution [Line: 59]

## Known Issues

None explicitly documented, but system is in active development based on TODO comments.

## Performance Considerations

1. **Caching Strategy**

   - Temporary key storage optimization
   - Validation result caching
   - Distributed cache support

2. **Event Distribution**
   - Asynchronous notification handling
   - Message broker integration
   - Event batching capabilities

## Security Considerations

1. **Defense in Depth** [Lines: 20-22]

   - Multiple validation layers
   - Strict policy enforcement
   - Comprehensive audit logging

2. **Compliance**
   - Security controls framework
   - Resource quota enforcement
   - Audit trail maintenance

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Module Organization**

   - **Decision**: Separate modules by functionality [Lines: 28-53]
   - **Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns
   - **Trade-off**: More files vs. better organization

2. **Type System**

   - **Decision**: Extensive type definitions [Lines: 52-53]
   - **Rationale**: Type safety and consistency
   - **Trade-off**: Additional code vs. runtime safety

3. **Public API**
   - **Decision**: Explicit **all** definition [Lines: 62-82]
   - **Rationale**: Clear API surface
   - **Trade-off**: Maintenance overhead vs. API clarity
