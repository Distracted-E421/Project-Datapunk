## Purpose

Implements a multi-level approval chain workflow system for policy changes, supporting both sequential and parallel approval patterns with configurable steps and notifications.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **ApprovalStep Class** [Lines: 11-24]

   - Represents individual approval steps
   - Tracks approver requirements
   - Manages approval state
   - Timestamps completion

2. **ApprovalChain Class** [Lines: 26-276]
   - Orchestrates approval workflows
   - Manages state transitions
   - Handles notifications
   - Tracks metrics

### Key Features

1. **Chain Management** [Lines: 52-86]

   - Chain creation and storage
   - Step configuration
   - Initial approver notification
   - Metrics tracking

2. **Approval Processing** [Lines: 88-142]

   - Approver validation
   - State transition management
   - Step completion handling
   - Chain completion

3. **State Management** [Lines: 144-178]

   - Cache-based persistence
   - Chain retrieval
   - State updates
   - TTL alignment

4. **Step Navigation** [Lines: 180-225]
   - Current step identification
   - Next step determination
   - Sequential progression
   - Parallel approval support

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- typing: Type hints and annotations
- structlog: Structured logging
- dataclasses: Data structure definitions
- datetime: Timestamp handling

### Internal Dependencies

- policy_approval: Approval types and status
- policy_notifications: Notification management
- cache: State persistence
- metrics: Monitoring and tracking

## Known Issues

1. **Approval Rejection** [Lines: 88-89]

   - Missing support for rejection handling
   - Rollback functionality needed
   - FIXME noted in code

2. **Audit Trail** [Lines: 90]

   - Comment persistence not implemented
   - Audit logging incomplete
   - TODO noted in code

3. **Chain Completion** [Lines: 226-276]
   - Missing chain archival logic
   - Notification failure handling incomplete
   - FIXME and TODO noted

## Performance Considerations

1. **Cache Usage** [Lines: 144-178]

   - State persistence in cache
   - TTL alignment critical
   - Potential for orphaned data

2. **Notification Delivery** [Lines: 42-43]
   - Missing retry logic
   - TODO for implementation
   - Performance impact noted

## Security Considerations

1. **Approver Validation** [Lines: 113-114]

   - Strict authorization checks
   - Set-based approver validation
   - Unauthorized access prevention

2. **State Management** [Lines: 144-178]
   - Secure chain storage
   - TTL-based expiration
   - Cache security dependencies

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **State Storage**

   - **Decision**: Cache-based state management [Lines: 144-178]
   - **Rationale**: Fast access and automatic expiration
   - **Trade-off**: Persistence vs performance

2. **Approval Flow**

   - **Decision**: Sequential steps with parallel approvers [Lines: 180-225]
   - **Rationale**: Flexible approval patterns
   - **Trade-off**: Complexity vs flexibility

3. **Notification Handling**
   - **Decision**: Immediate notification on state changes [Lines: 52-86]
   - **Rationale**: Real-time approver updates
   - **Trade-off**: System load vs user experience
