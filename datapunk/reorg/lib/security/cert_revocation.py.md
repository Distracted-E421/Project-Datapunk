## Purpose

This module implements a robust certificate revocation system for Datapunk's service mesh security infrastructure, providing real-time certificate status management with a dual-layer approach using both CRL and distributed cache.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **CertificateRevocationManager Class** [Lines: 31-158]
   - Manages certificate revocation across service mesh
   - Implements dual-layer revocation system
   - Handles distributed cache updates
   - Maintains CRL consistency

### Key Features

1. **Certificate Revocation** [Lines: 49-94]

   - Atomic revocation operation
   - Race condition prevention
   - Service certificate invalidation
   - Distributed cache updates
   - Error handling with logging

2. **Revocation Status Checking** [Lines: 96-113]

   - Fast-path cache checking
   - Authoritative CRL verification
   - Fail-closed error handling
   - Real-time status updates

3. **CRL Management** [Lines: 115-158]
   - CRL updates and storage
   - Cache synchronization
   - TTL-based cache management
   - Efficient lookup operations

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- `cryptography`: Certificate and CRL handling [Lines: 23-25]
- `structlog`: Structured logging [Lines: 21]
- `asyncio`: Asynchronous operations [Lines: 19]
- `datetime`: Timestamp handling [Lines: 20]

### Internal Modules

- `.mtls`: Certificate management [Lines: 26]
- `..cache`: Distributed caching [Lines: 27]

## Known Issues

1. **Distributed Operations** [Lines: 71]
   - FIXME: Missing retry logic for distributed operations
   - Could lead to inconsistency in failure cases
   - Needs implementation of retry mechanism

## Performance Considerations

1. **Cache Optimization** [Lines: 101-102]

   - Fast-path cache checking
   - 24-hour TTL for revocation cache
   - 1-hour TTL for CRL cache

2. **Distributed Operations** [Lines: 42-44]
   - Cache client requires distributed support
   - Mesh-wide revocation propagation
   - Optimized for service mesh scale

## Security Considerations

1. **Fail-Closed Model** [Lines: 111-113]

   - Treats errors as revoked certificates
   - Ensures security in failure cases
   - Conservative security approach

2. **Consistency Management** [Lines: 54-61]
   - Ordered operations to prevent race conditions
   - Atomic updates where possible
   - Maintains CRL and cache consistency

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Dual-Layer System**

   - **Decision**: Use both CRL and cache [Lines: 35-38]
   - **Rationale**: Balance between performance and reliability
   - **Trade-off**: Additional complexity vs performance gain

2. **Cache TTLs**

   - **Decision**: Different TTLs for revocation (24h) and CRL (1h) [Lines: 130, 149]
   - **Rationale**: Balance freshness with performance
   - **Trade-off**: Consistency vs cache efficiency

3. **Error Handling**
   - **Decision**: Fail-closed approach [Lines: 111-113]
   - **Rationale**: Security over availability
   - **Trade-off**: Potential false positives vs security
