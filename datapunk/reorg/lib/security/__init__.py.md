## Purpose

This module serves as the package initializer for the Datapunk security infrastructure, providing a namespace for security-related components.

## Implementation

The file is a simple package initializer that establishes the security module's namespace within the Datapunk shared library structure.

### Core Components

1. **Package Initialization** [Lines: 1-2]
   - Defines the security package namespace
   - Located in the shared Datapunk library structure

## Dependencies

None - This is a pure namespace package.

## Known Issues

None - Simple namespace initialization.

## Performance Considerations

None - Package initialization has no performance impact.

## Security Considerations

None - Package initialization does not affect security directly.

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Package Structure**
   - **Decision**: Maintain security components in shared library [Lines: 1]
   - **Rationale**: Centralized security infrastructure for reuse
   - **Trade-off**: None - Standard Python package organization
