## Purpose

This module implements automated certificate lifecycle management within Datapunk's service mesh, ensuring continuous service availability through proactive certificate rotation before expiration.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **CertificateRotationManager Class** [Lines: 33-139]
   - Manages proactive certificate rotation
   - Window-based rotation strategy
   - Metrics tracking and monitoring
   - Error handling with metrics

### Key Features

1. **Certificate Monitoring** [Lines: 54-74]

   - Automated expiration checking
   - Proactive rotation scheduling
   - TODO: Parallel rotation support
   - TODO: Rate limiting implementation

2. **Rotation Decision Logic** [Lines: 76-98]

   - Window-based expiration checking
   - Fail-safe parsing approach
   - Configurable rotation window
   - Error handling with logging

3. **Certificate Rotation** [Lines: 100-139]
   - Atomic rotation operation
   - Service configuration updates
   - Metrics tracking
   - Error handling with metrics

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- `cryptography`: Certificate handling [Lines: 25-26]
- `structlog`: Structured logging [Lines: 24]
- `asyncio`: Asynchronous operations [Lines: 22]
- `datetime`: Time calculations [Lines: 23]

### Internal Modules

- `.mtls`: Certificate management [Lines: 27]
- `..monitoring`: Metrics reporting [Lines: 28]

## Known Issues

1. **Configuration Flexibility** [Lines: 48]

   - FIXME: Rotation window not configurable per service
   - Could limit service-specific requirements
   - Needs configuration enhancement

2. **Parallel Processing** [Lines: 63]

   - TODO: Missing parallel rotation support
   - Could impact performance at scale
   - Sequential processing limitation

3. **Rate Limiting** [Lines: 64]
   - TODO: Missing rate limiting implementation
   - Could impact system resources
   - Needs throttling mechanism

## Performance Considerations

1. **Sequential Processing** [Lines: 65-69]

   - Currently processes one certificate at a time
   - May impact performance at scale
   - Future parallel processing planned

2. **Metrics Collection** [Lines: 45-47]
   - Real-time metrics tracking
   - Success/failure counters
   - Performance impact monitoring

## Security Considerations

1. **Fail-Safe Approach** [Lines: 92-97]

   - Treats parsing failures as rotation triggers
   - Conservative security stance
   - Prevents certificate expiration

2. **Service Continuity** [Lines: 108-110]
   - Note about potential service restart requirements
   - Careful coordination needed
   - Impact on service availability

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Window-Based Strategy**

   - **Decision**: Use time window for rotation [Lines: 47]
   - **Rationale**: Proactive rotation before expiration
   - **Trade-off**: Early rotation vs operational overhead

2. **Error Handling**

   - **Decision**: Fail-safe approach with metrics [Lines: 92-97]
   - **Rationale**: Security over efficiency
   - **Trade-off**: Potential unnecessary rotations vs security

3. **Metrics Integration**
   - **Decision**: Comprehensive metrics tracking [Lines: 131-138]
   - **Rationale**: Operational visibility
   - **Trade-off**: Performance impact vs monitoring capability
