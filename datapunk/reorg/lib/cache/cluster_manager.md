# Cluster Manager Documentation

## Purpose

Manages a distributed cache cluster using consistent hashing for data distribution and master-slave replication for high availability. Implements node health monitoring, automatic failover, and cluster-wide key synchronization through Redis pub/sub mechanism.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **ClusterNode** [Lines: 19-39]

   - Represents individual nodes in the cache cluster
   - Manages connection state and health monitoring
   - Supports weighted key distribution through node weights
   - Tracks node status (connecting, connected, error)

2. **ClusterManager** [Lines: 41-293]
   - Implements consistent hashing with virtual nodes
   - Handles master election and failover
   - Manages cluster-wide key synchronization
   - Monitors node health through heartbeats

### Key Features

1. **Consistent Hashing** [Lines: 97-114]

   - Uses virtual nodes (160 per physical node) for even distribution
   - O(log n) key lookup performance
   - Supports weighted node distribution
   - Handles ring rebuilding on topology changes

2. **Master Election** [Lines: 162-181]

   - Simple election using node_id as tiebreaker
   - Automatic re-election on master failure
   - Supports only connected nodes as candidates
   - TODO noted for implementing Raft algorithm

3. **Health Monitoring** [Lines: 208-243]

   - 5-second heartbeat interval
   - Automatic failure detection
   - Triggers master re-election on failures
   - Collects node health metrics

4. **Key Synchronization** [Lines: 115-147, 245-293]
   - Pub/sub based synchronization
   - Eventually consistent updates
   - Handles node-specific failures gracefully
   - Supports TTL preservation

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- aioredis: Redis client for async operations [Lines: 17]
- asyncio: Async runtime for concurrent operations [Lines: 12]
- json: Data serialization [Lines: 13]
- datetime: Timestamp management [Lines: 15]

### Internal Modules

- cache_types: CacheConfig and CacheEntry types [Lines: 17]
- monitoring.metrics: MetricsClient for monitoring [Lines: 18]

## Known Issues

1. **Consistency Model** [Lines: 116-119]

   - Eventually consistent synchronization
   - Brief windows of inconsistency during updates
   - No strong consistency guarantees

2. **Master Election** [Lines: 164-166]
   - Simple election algorithm
   - Potential split-brain scenarios
   - TODO: Implement Raft for better partition tolerance

## Performance Considerations

1. **Virtual Nodes** [Lines: 71-73]

   - 160 virtual nodes per physical node
   - Improves distribution but increases memory usage
   - Configurable for performance tuning

2. **Heartbeat Interval** [Lines: 210-214]

   - 5-second interval balances responsiveness and overhead
   - Affects failure detection speed
   - Network traffic considerations

3. **Synchronization** [Lines: 246-250]
   - Single-key synchronization model
   - FIXME noted for implementing batch synchronization
   - Potential performance bottleneck for high-change scenarios

## Security Considerations

1. **Node Authentication** [Lines: 149-161]

   - Basic Redis connection security
   - No additional authentication layer
   - Consider implementing node verification

2. **Master Authority** [Lines: 115-147]
   - Master node controls synchronization
   - No validation of master authority
   - Potential security risk in untrusted networks

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Consistent Hashing**

   - **Decision**: Use virtual nodes [Lines: 71-73]
   - **Rationale**: Better distribution and weight support
   - **Trade-off**: Memory usage vs distribution quality

2. **Synchronization Model**

   - **Decision**: Eventually consistent pub/sub [Lines: 245-293]
   - **Rationale**: Better performance and availability
   - **Trade-off**: Consistency vs availability

3. **Health Monitoring**
   - **Decision**: 5-second heartbeat interval [Lines: 208-243]
   - **Rationale**: Balance between responsiveness and overhead
   - **Trade-off**: Detection speed vs network traffic

## Future Improvements

1. **Master Election** [Lines: 164-166]

   - Implement Raft consensus algorithm
   - Add partition tolerance
   - Improve split-brain handling

2. **Synchronization** [Lines: 246-250]

   - Implement batch synchronization
   - Add conflict resolution
   - Optimize for high-change scenarios

3. **Security** [Lines: 149-161]
   - Add node authentication
   - Implement secure master election
   - Add encryption for node communication
