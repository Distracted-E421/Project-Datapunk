## Purpose

A distributed caching system that provides flexible caching strategies with cluster support. The module implements a Redis-based caching layer with support for standalone and distributed operations, offering features like write-behind caching, automatic node selection, TTL management, and comprehensive metrics collection.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **CacheManager Class** [Lines: 16-381]
   - Manages cache operations in both standalone and cluster modes
   - Handles distributed caching with automatic node selection
   - Implements write-behind caching for performance optimization
   - Provides metrics collection and error handling

### Key Features

1. **Cluster-Aware Operations** [Lines: 31-64]

   - Automatic mode selection between standalone and cluster
   - Dynamic Redis connection management per operation
   - Cluster node initialization and configuration

2. **Cache Operations** [Lines: 78-151]

   - Get operation with automatic source fetching
   - Namespace isolation for cache entries
   - Access statistics tracking
   - Automatic cache invalidation

3. **Write Operations** [Lines: 176-260]

   - Support for write-behind caching
   - Cluster synchronization for distributed setups
   - TTL management and metadata tracking
   - Error handling with detailed context

4. **Cache Invalidation** [Lines: 262-312]

   - Single key invalidation
   - Namespace-wide clearing
   - Cursor-based scanning for efficient operations

5. **Write-Behind Processing** [Lines: 314-363]
   - Background task for batch processing
   - Buffer management for write operations
   - Automatic retry on failures
   - Configurable batch intervals

- cluster_manager: Distributed cluster management [Lines: 14]

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- aioredis: Redis client for Python with asyncio support
- python-json: Standard library for JSON operations
- python-logging: Standard library for logging
- python-asyncio: Standard library for async operations

### Internal Modules

- cache_types: Provides CacheStrategy, InvalidationStrategy, CacheConfig, CacheEntry
- error.error_types: Defines ServiceError, ErrorCategory, ErrorContext
- monitoring.metrics: Implements MetricsClient for performance tracking
- cluster_manager: Implements ClusterManager and ClusterNode for distribution

## Known Issues

1. **Write-Behind Data Loss** [Lines: 190-192]

   - Writes may be lost on system failure before batch processing
   - No built-in recovery mechanism
   - Consider implementing write-ahead logging

2. **Cluster Consistency** [Lines: 27-29]
   - Eventual consistency model in cluster mode
   - Possible stale reads during node synchronization
   - Trade-off favors performance over consistency

## Performance Considerations

1. **Write-Behind Caching** [Lines: 314-363]

   - Improves write performance through batching
   - Reduces load on storage backend
   - Configurable batch size and intervals
   - Memory overhead from write buffer

2. **Cluster Operations** [Lines: 99-105]

   - Per-operation connection management adds overhead
   - Node selection impacts request latency
   - Connection pooling could be implemented

3. **Namespace Clearing** [Lines: 288-312]
   - Resource-intensive on large datasets
   - Uses cursor-based scanning for memory efficiency
   - Consider rate limiting or off-peak execution

## Security Considerations

1. **Error Handling** [Lines: 153-166]

   - Detailed error context without exposing internals
   - Structured error responses
   - Proper logging of failures

2. **Configuration Management** [Lines: 31-47]
   - Secure handling of Redis connection URLs
   - Cluster configuration validation
   - No hardcoded credentials

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Consistency vs Performance**

   - **Decision**: Eventual consistency in cluster mode [Lines: 27-29]
   - **Rationale**: Prioritizes performance and availability
   - **Trade-off**: Possible stale reads vs reduced latency

2. **Write-Behind Caching**

   - **Decision**: Optional write-behind with buffering [Lines: 314-363]
   - **Rationale**: Improves write performance and reduces backend load
   - **Trade-off**: Potential data loss vs improved performance

3. **Connection Management**
   - **Decision**: Per-operation connections in cluster mode [Lines: 45-47]
   - **Rationale**: Ensures proper node selection and key distribution
   - **Trade-off**: Connection overhead vs accurate key distribution

## Future Improvements

1. **Write-Behind Enhancement** [Lines: 323-325]

   - Add retry logic for failed batch writes
   - Implement configurable batch size limits
   - Add write-ahead logging for durability

2. **Cluster Operations** [Lines: 99-105]

   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add circuit breaker for node failures
   - Optimize node selection algorithm

3. **Monitoring** [Lines: 127-131, 168-174]
   - Add more detailed performance metrics
   - Implement health checks
   - Add alerting for critical operations
