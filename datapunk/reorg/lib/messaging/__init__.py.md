## Known Issues

None identified

## Performance Considerations

No performance implications as this is a simple package initializer.

## Security Considerations

No security implications as this is a simple package initializer.

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Minimal Implementation**
   - **Decision**: Keep initializer empty [Lines: 1-2]
   - **Rationale**: No package-level initialization needed
   - **Trade-off**: Simplicity vs potential future initialization needs
