## Purpose

This module serves as the initialization file for the pubsub package, establishing the namespace for pub/sub messaging functionality.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Package Initialization** [Lines: 1-2]
   - Empty initializer file
   - Marks directory as Python package containing pub/sub messaging components

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

None

### Internal Modules

None

## Known Issues

None identified

## Performance Considerations

No performance implications as this is a simple package initializer.

## Security Considerations

No security implications as this is a simple package initializer.

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Minimal Implementation**
   - **Decision**: Keep initializer empty
   - **Rationale**: No package-level initialization needed
   - **Trade-off**: Simplicity vs potential future initialization needs
