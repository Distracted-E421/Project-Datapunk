# Volume Configuration Documentation

## Purpose

Defines storage volume configurations for Datapunk's core services, including data persistence, caching, and model storage. This configuration manages storage paths, permissions, backup locations, and performance optimizations for each service component.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Lake Service Storage** [Lines: 6-16]

   - Primary data storage for vector, timeseries, and blob data
   - Includes backup location and disaster recovery configuration
   - Performance-optimized mount options for high I/O workload
   - Service-specific user isolation

2. **Stream Service Storage** [Lines: 20-29]

   - High-throughput event processing storage
   - Real-time analytics data storage
   - Matches Lake service's performance optimizations
   - Separate backup path configuration

3. **Nexus Service Cache** [Lines: 33-39]

   - Temporary storage for API gateway
   - Auth services caching
   - Size-limited cache (10GB)
   - Daily cleanup schedule

4. **Model Cache** [Lines: 48-53]
   - ML model storage
   - LRU cleanup policy
   - 50GB size limit
   - Standard permissions and ownership

### Key Features

1. **Backup Configuration** [Lines: 9, 23]

   - Separate backup paths for each service
   - Service-specific backup locations
   - Disaster recovery support

2. **Performance Optimizations** [Lines: 13-15, 26-28]

   - noatime mount option to reduce I/O overhead
   - nodiratime for directory access optimization
   - Specific to high I/O services

3. **Security Controls** [Lines: 10-11, 24-25, 38-39, 52-53]
   - Restrictive permissions (0755)
   - Service-specific user ownership
   - Isolation between services

## Dependencies

### Internal Modules

- sys-arch.mmd: StorageLayer->Storage reference [Line: 2]

## Known Issues

1. **Volume Monitoring** [Lines: 19]

   - Missing capacity planning monitoring
   - Affects Stream service storage management
   - No current implementation

2. **Cache Management** [Lines: 32]
   - FIXME: Stale cache entries in Nexus service
   - Requires auto-cleanup implementation
   - Currently relies on daily cleanup interval

## Performance Considerations

1. **I/O Optimization** [Lines: 13-15]

   - Mount options reduce filesystem overhead
   - Skips access time updates
   - Critical for high-throughput services

2. **Cache Sizing** [Lines: 36, 50]
   - Fixed cache size limits
   - Prevents unbounded growth
   - May need adjustment based on usage

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control** [Lines: 10-11]

   - Restrictive filesystem permissions
   - Service-specific user isolation
   - Prevents unauthorized access

2. **Missing Security Features** [Lines: 41-43]
   - Volume encryption not implemented
   - Backup retention policies undefined
   - Security implications for sensitive data

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Cache Size Limits**

   - **Decision**: Fixed cache sizes [Lines: 36, 50]
   - **Rationale**: Prevent resource exhaustion
   - **Trade-off**: May limit performance vs unlimited growth

2. **Mount Options**
   - **Decision**: Performance over metadata accuracy [Lines: 13-15]
   - **Rationale**: Optimize for high I/O workload
   - **Trade-off**: Less accurate access times for better performance

## Future Improvements

1. **Security Enhancements** [Lines: 41-46]

   - Volume encryption implementation
   - Backup retention policies
   - Volume expansion thresholds
   - Health check endpoints

2. **Monitoring** [Lines: 19, 45]
   - Volume capacity monitoring
   - Performance monitoring hooks
   - Health check implementation
