## Purpose

The Lake Service Container is a core component of the Data Services layer that manages data sovereignty and storage. It implements a multi-stage build process to optimize container size and security while providing separate configurations for development and production environments.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Build Stage** [Lines: 8-23]

   - Creates optimized dependency layer
   - Uses datapunk-base-python:dev as base
   - Installs production dependencies via Poetry
   - Runs as non-root user for security

2. **Development Stage** [Lines: 25-47]

   - Provides additional debugging capabilities
   - Includes development tools and configurations
   - Exposes debugger port 5678
   - Sets development-specific environment variables

3. **Runtime Stage** [Lines: 49-73]
   - Final production stage
   - Copies built artifacts from builder stage
   - Implements health checking
   - Exposes service port 8000

### Key Features

1. **Security Measures** [Lines: 11-12]

   - Non-root user execution
   - File ownership controls with app:datapunk

2. **Health Monitoring** [Lines: 65-66]

   - Regular health checks every 30s
   - Configurable retry and timeout parameters

3. **Environment Configuration** [Lines: 42-44]
   - PYTHONPATH configuration
   - Debug mode settings
   - Environment-specific variables

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- datapunk-base-python:dev: Base image for all stages [Lines: 8, 25, 49]
- Poetry: Package management and dependency installation [Lines: 23]

### Internal Dependencies

- src/main.py: Main service entry point [Line: 73]
- scripts/healthcheck.sh: Health monitoring script [Line: 66]

## Known Issues

1. **Docker Configuration** [Lines: 13-14]

   - FIXME: Needs improved .dockerignore configuration
   - Impact: Potential inclusion of unnecessary files
   - Workaround: Currently using manual file copying

2. **Development Tools** [Lines: 38-43]
   - TODO: Missing development-specific configurations:
     - Health checks
     - Debugging tools
     - Profiling setup
     - SSL certificates
     - Logging
     - Hot reload
   - Impact: Limited development capabilities
   - Workaround: Manual configuration as needed

## Performance Considerations

1. **Build Optimization** [Lines: 8-23]

   - Multi-stage build reduces final image size
   - Separate production and development dependencies
   - Optimized layer caching through strategic COPY commands

2. **Health Monitoring** [Lines: 65-66]
   - Regular health checks may impact performance
   - Configurable intervals and timeouts
   - 30-second check interval with 10-second timeout

## Security Considerations

1. **User Permissions** [Lines: 11-12]

   - Non-root user execution
   - Restricted file permissions
   - Dedicated app user and datapunk group

2. **Dependency Management** [Line: 23]
   - TODO: Missing dependency audit step
   - Production-only dependencies in runtime
   - Controlled file copying between stages

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Multi-stage Build**

   - **Decision**: Use three-stage build process [Lines: 8, 25, 49]
   - **Rationale**: Optimize image size while supporting development
   - **Trade-off**: Added build complexity vs. smaller runtime image

2. **Development Environment**
   - **Decision**: Separate development stage [Lines: 25-47]
   - **Rationale**: Provide debugging capabilities without impacting production
   - **Trade-off**: Larger development image vs. better developer experience

## Future Improvements

1. **Security** [Lines: 23]

   - Add dependency audit step
   - Implement file integrity checks
   - Enhanced access controls

2. **Development Tools** [Lines: 38-43]
   - Add development-specific health checks
   - Configure debugging tools
   - Set up profiling tools
   - Add SSL certificates
   - Implement development logging
   - Add hot reload capability
