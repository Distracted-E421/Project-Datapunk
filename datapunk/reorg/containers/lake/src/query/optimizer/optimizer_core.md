3. **CostBasedOptimizer** [Lines: 61-90]
   - Cost-aware optimization extension
   - Threshold-based optimization
   - Statistical decision making
   - Performance improvement validation

### Key Features

1. **Rule Management** [Lines: 21-27]

   - Flexible rule configuration
   - Rule collection maintenance

2. **Optimization Process** [Lines: 29-51]

   - Iterative improvement
   - Best plan selection
   - Cost-based decisions
   - Convergence detection

3. **Statistics Handling** [Lines: 53-60]
   - Table statistics caching
   - Dynamic statistics updates
   - Statistical data retrieval
   - Performance data management

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- abc: Abstract base class support
- typing: Type hint definitions

### Internal Modules

- query_parser_core: Query plan structures (QueryPlan, QueryNode)

## Known Issues

1. **Optimization Loop** [Lines: 37-49]

   - No maximum iteration limit
   - Potential infinite loops
   - Memory usage during iteration

2. **Cost Estimation** [Lines: 13-16]
   - Abstract cost model
   - No standardized metrics
   - Implementation-dependent accuracy

## Performance Considerations

1. **Rule Application** [Lines: 37-49]

   - Multiple plan iterations
   - Memory for plan copies
   - Cost calculation overhead

2. **Statistics Cache** [Lines: 53-60]
   - Memory usage for statistics
   - Cache invalidation timing
   - Update frequency impact

## Security Considerations

1. **Statistics Access** [Lines: 53-60]

   - Statistics data protection
   - Access control needed
   - Sensitive data handling

2. **Query Plan Validation** [Lines: 29-51]
   - Plan integrity checks
   - Resource limit enforcement
   - Input validation

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Rule-Based Architecture**

   - **Decision**: Abstract rule system [Lines: 5-16]
   - **Rationale**: Extensibility and modularity
   - **Trade-off**: Complexity vs. flexibility

2. **Cost-Based Optimization**

   - **Decision**: Threshold-based improvements [Lines: 61-90]
   - **Rationale**: Performance guarantees
   - **Trade-off**: Optimization time vs. plan quality

3. **Statistics Management**
   - **Decision**: In-memory statistics cache [Lines: 53-60]
   - **Rationale**: Quick access to statistics
   - **Trade-off**: Memory usage vs. lookup speed

## Future Improvements

   - Implement parallel optimization
   - Add plan caching

2. **Cost Model** [Lines: 13-16]

   - Standardize cost metrics
   - Add cost model validation
   - Implement learning-based cost estimation

3. **Statistics Management** [Lines: 53-60]
   - Add cache eviction policies
   - Implement statistics versioning
   - Add real-time statistics updates
