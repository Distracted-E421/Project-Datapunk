# Adaptive Query Execution Module

## Purpose

Provides adaptive query execution capabilities that dynamically adjust query execution strategies based on runtime statistics and data characteristics. This module enables the query engine to make intelligent decisions about execution plans during runtime.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Statistics Class** [Lines: 8-32]

   - Maintains runtime statistics for adaptive execution
   - Tracks row counts, execution times, memory usage, and cardinality estimates
   - Provides methods to update various metrics per operator

2. **AdaptiveContext** [Lines: 34-49]

   - Extends ExecutionContext with adaptive execution support
   - Manages adaptation thresholds and sampling parameters
   - Determines when adaptation is needed based on statistics

3. **AdaptiveOperator** [Lines: 51-132]

   - Base class for adaptive operators
   - Implements runtime adaptation logic
   - Handles data sampling and strategy selection
   - Collects and updates statistics during execution

4. **AdaptiveJoin** [Lines: 134-146]

   - Specialized adaptive operator for join operations
   - Switches between hash join and merge join based on data size
   - Uses row count as the primary decision factor

5. **AdaptiveAggregation** [Lines: 148-163]

   - Specialized adaptive operator for aggregation operations
   - Chooses between parallel and standard aggregation
   - Considers both row count and distinct value count

6. **AdaptiveExecutionEngine** [Lines: 165-205]
   - Main engine for adaptive query processing
   - Builds and manages adaptive execution trees
   - Handles execution statistics logging

### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Strategy Selection** [Lines: 63-91]

   - Samples data to gather initial statistics
   - Chooses execution strategies based on data characteristics
   - Adapts strategies during runtime based on actual performance

2. **Statistical Monitoring** [Lines: 92-97]

   - Periodically updates execution statistics
   - Tracks row counts, execution times, and memory usage
   - Uses statistics for adaptation decisions

3. **Adaptive Join Processing** [Lines: 134-146]

   - Switches join strategies based on data size
   - Uses hash join for small datasets (<1000 rows)
   - Uses merge join for large datasets

4. **Adaptive Aggregation** [Lines: 148-163]
   - Adapts aggregation strategy based on data characteristics
   - Uses parallel processing for large datasets with few distinct values
   - Falls back to standard processing for other cases

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- `abc`: Abstract base classes
- `time`: Time measurement utilities

### Internal Modules

- `.parallel`: Parallel execution operators
- `..parser.core`: Query plan parsing and representation

## Known Issues

1. **Sampling Overhead** [Lines: 98-106]
   - Initial sampling may add overhead for small datasets
   - Sample size is fixed and may not be optimal for all cases

## Performance Considerations

1. **Adaptation Overhead** [Lines: 77-91]

   - Strategy changes during execution may cause temporary slowdowns
   - Periodic statistics updates add some overhead

2. **Memory Usage** [Lines: 98-106]
   - Sampling keeps data in memory
   - Statistics tracking requires additional memory

## Security Considerations

1. **Resource Management**
   - No explicit resource limits on sampling
   - Memory usage should be monitored during adaptation

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Fixed Sample Size** [Line: 39]

   - Uses fixed 1000-row sample size
   - Trade-off between accuracy and overhead
   - Could be made configurable for different workloads

2. **Adaptation Threshold** [Line: 38]

   - Set to 0.5 (50% error) for adaptation triggers
   - Balance between stability and responsiveness

3. **Strategy Selection** [Lines: 134-163]
   - Simple threshold-based decisions
   - Prioritizes simplicity over complex cost models

## Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic Sampling**

   - Implement adaptive sample size based on data characteristics
   - Add progressive sampling for large datasets

2. **Cost-based Adaptation**

   - Incorporate more sophisticated cost models
   - Consider system resources in adaptation decisions

3. **Additional Strategies**
   - Add more join and aggregation strategies
   - Implement adaptive operators for other operations
