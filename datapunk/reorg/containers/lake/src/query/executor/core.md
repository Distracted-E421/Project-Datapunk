# Query Execution Core Module

## Purpose

Provides the foundational components for query execution, implementing the core operator framework and basic query operations. This module serves as the backbone of the query execution engine, defining the execution context, operator hierarchy, and basic query operations.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **ExecutionContext** [Lines: 6-24]

   - Maintains execution state and variables
   - Tracks execution statistics
   - Manages cache integration
   - Provides variable management

2. **ExecutionOperator Base** [Lines: 26-41]

   - Abstract base class for all operators
   - Defines operator interface
   - Manages operator hierarchy
   - Handles child operators

3. **Basic Operators** [Lines: 43-132]

   - TableScanOperator: Data source access
   - FilterOperator: Row filtering
   - JoinOperator: Data set joining
   - ProjectOperator: Column selection

4. **Aggregation Support** [Lines: 134-205]

   - AggregateOperator implementation
   - Group-by processing
   - Aggregate function management
   - Result finalization

5. **ExecutionEngine** [Lines: 207-247]
   - Main query execution orchestrator
   - Plan to operator tree conversion
   - Execution context management
   - Cache integration

### Key Features

1. **Operator Framework** [Lines: 26-41]

   - Extensible operator design
   - Composable operator trees
   - Iterator-based execution
   - Context sharing

2. **Query Operations** [Lines: 43-132]

   - Table scanning with caching
   - Predicate evaluation
   - Join condition processing
   - Column projection

3. **Aggregation Processing** [Lines: 134-205]

   - Group-by handling
   - Multiple aggregate functions
   - Incremental aggregation
   - Null value handling

4. **Execution Management** [Lines: 207-247]
   - Query plan interpretation
   - Operator tree construction
   - Execution orchestration
   - Error handling

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- `abc`: Abstract base classes
- `typing`: Type hints and annotations

### Internal Modules

- `..parser.core`: Query plan structures
- `...storage.cache`: Cache management

## Known Issues

1. **Table Scan** [Lines: 43-59]

   - Direct table scan not implemented
   - Relies on cache manager
   - No storage engine integration

2. **Join Performance** [Lines: 98-121]
   - Simple nested loop join
   - Buffers entire right side
   - Memory intensive for large joins

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Usage** [Lines: 98-121]

   - Full result materialization
   - Right-side buffering in joins
   - Group-by state maintenance

2. **Execution Efficiency** [Lines: 134-205]
   - Multiple passes for aggregation
   - Sequential processing
   - No parallel execution

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Access**

   - No access control integration
   - Raw data exposure in context
   - No query validation

2. **Resource Control**
   - No execution limits
   - Unbounded memory usage
   - No timeout mechanism

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Iterator Model** [Lines: 26-41]

   - Pull-based execution
   - Memory efficient streaming
   - Limited optimization opportunities

2. **Operator Hierarchy** [Lines: 26-41]

   - Simple inheritance model
   - Easy to extend
   - Limited operator cooperation

3. **Execution Context** [Lines: 6-24]
   - Shared state container
   - Simple variable management
   - Limited scope isolation

## Future Improvements

1. **Storage Integration**

   - Implement direct table scan
   - Add storage engine abstraction
   - Support multiple backends

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Add parallel execution
   - Implement join optimizations
   - Add operator pipelining

3. **Resource Management**
   - Add execution limits
   - Implement memory management
   - Add query timeouts
