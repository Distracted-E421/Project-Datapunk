# Query Federation Rules Module

## Purpose

This module implements optimization rules for federated query processing. It provides a set of rules that optimize query execution across distributed data sources by handling push-down operations, data locality, materialization, and partition pruning.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **PushDownRule** [Lines: 13-184]

   - Pushes operations closer to data sources
   - Handles filters, projections, and aggregates
   - Optimizes query performance by reducing data movement
   - Considers operation volatility and dependencies

2. **DataLocalityRule** [Lines: 185-500]

   - Optimizes data locality
   - Minimizes data movement across sources
   - Analyzes data placement
   - Determines optimal execution locations

3. **MaterializationRule** [Lines: 501-650]

   - Identifies materialization opportunities
   - Evaluates materialization benefits
   - Manages materialized views
   - Optimizes query performance through caching

4. **PartitionPruningRule** [Lines: 651-750]

   - Optimizes partition access
   - Analyzes partition predicates
   - Identifies prunable partitions
   - Reduces data scan overhead

5. **FederatedIndexRule** [Lines: 751-822]
   - Manages index usage across sources
   - Selects optimal indexes
   - Scores index effectiveness
   - Applies index hints to query plan

   - Predicate extraction
   - Partition evaluation
   - Access optimization
   - Pruning strategy

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- typing: Type hints
- dataclasses: Data structure definitions
- ..optimizer.core: Base optimization classes
- .query_fed_core: Federation core components

### Internal Dependencies

- QueryPlan: Query plan representation

## Known Issues

1. **Push-Down Limitations** [Lines: 38-184]

   - Limited handling of complex expressions
   - Basic volatility detection
   - No cost-based push-down decisions

2. **Data Locality** [Lines: 185-300]

   - Simple network cost model
   - Basic location optimization
   - Limited cross-source optimization

3. **Materialization** [Lines: 501-600]
   - Fixed benefit thresholds
   - Basic view selection
   - Limited maintenance strategies

## Performance Considerations

1. **Query Optimization**

   - Push-down reduces data movement
   - Locality optimization minimizes network overhead
   - Materialization improves repeated query performance
   - Partition pruning reduces scan overhead

2. **Resource Usage**
   - Memory usage for materialized views
   - CPU overhead for rule application
   - Network bandwidth for data movement
   - Storage for materialized results

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Access**

   - No explicit security checks
   - Assumes secure data sources
   - No credential management
   - Basic access patterns

2. **Resource Protection**
   - Limited resource quotas
   - No explicit rate limiting
   - Basic error handling
   - Minimal validation

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Push-Down Strategy**

   - **Decision**: Aggressive push-down [Lines: 38-184]
   - **Rationale**: Minimize data movement
   - **Trade-off**: Potential source overload

2. **Materialization Policy**

   - **Decision**: Cost-based selection [Lines: 501-600]
   - **Rationale**: Optimize resource usage
   - **Trade-off**: Storage vs. performance

3. **Partition Handling**
   - **Decision**: Dynamic pruning [Lines: 651-750]
   - **Rationale**: Reduce scan overhead
   - **Trade-off**: Analysis overhead

## Future Improvements

   - View eviction policies
   - Cost model refinement

3. **Partition Optimization**
   - Dynamic partition management
   - Advanced pruning strategies
   - Statistics-based decisions
   - Cross-source partitioning
