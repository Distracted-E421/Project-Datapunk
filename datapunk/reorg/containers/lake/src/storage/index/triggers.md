# Triggers Module Documentation

## Purpose

The triggers module provides automated monitoring and optimization of indexes based on configurable thresholds and performance metrics, enabling proactive maintenance and optimization.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **TriggerType Enum** [Lines: 18-25]

   - Defines types of optimization triggers
   - Includes: FRAGMENTATION, PERFORMANCE, SELECTIVITY, CACHE, SIZE, ERROR_RATE

2. **TriggerConfig Class** [Lines: 27-38]

   - Configuration settings for optimization triggers
   - Defines thresholds for various metrics
   - Controls monitoring intervals and cooldown periods

3. **TriggerEvent Class** [Lines: 40-47]

   - Represents optimization trigger events
   - Captures trigger type, timing, and threshold violations

4. **OptimizationTrigger Class** [Lines: 49-320]
   - Main class for monitoring and triggering optimizations
   - Manages monitoring thread and trigger checks
   - Implements optimization actions

### Key Features

1. **Automated Monitoring** [Lines: 89-107]

   - Background thread for continuous monitoring
   - Configurable check intervals
   - Thread-safe operation

2. **Performance Triggers** [Lines: 109-150]

   - Read/write time monitoring
   - Cache hit ratio analysis
   - Growth rate tracking

3. **Optimization Actions** [Lines: 290-320]
   - Index rebuilding
   - Cache optimization
   - Condition optimization
   - Size compaction

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- threading: Concurrent monitoring
- logging: Event logging
- dataclasses: Data structure definitions
- datetime: Time-based operations

### Internal Modules

- stats: Statistics store and management [Lines: 8-12]
- optimizer: Condition optimization [Line: 13]

## Known Issues

1. Optimization implementations are placeholder stubs
2. No rollback mechanism for failed optimizations
3. Limited to single-instance monitoring

## Performance Considerations

1. Background monitoring thread impact
2. Memory usage for trigger history
3. Potential lock contention in multi-threaded scenarios

## Security Considerations

1. Thread safety for shared resources
2. Resource limits for optimization operations
3. Logging of sensitive performance data

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Monitoring Approach**

   - Uses background thread for continuous monitoring
   - Trade-off: Resource usage vs. responsiveness

2. **Trigger Configuration**

   - Static thresholds with defaults
   - Trade-off: Simplicity vs. dynamic adaptation

3. **Optimization Actions**
   - Separate methods for different optimization types
   - Trade-off: Modularity vs. coordination complexity

## Future Improvements

1. Implement optimization action methods
2. Add dynamic threshold adjustment
3. Introduce optimization rollback mechanism
4. Add distributed monitoring support
5. Implement adaptive trigger intervals
