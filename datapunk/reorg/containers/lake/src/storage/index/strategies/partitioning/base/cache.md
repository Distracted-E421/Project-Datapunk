# Spatial Cache Module Documentation

## Purpose

This module provides a thread-safe caching mechanism for spatial data with Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction strategy, optimizing memory usage and access performance for spatial operations.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **SpatialCache Class** [Lines: 4-29]
   - Thread-safe cache implementation with LRU eviction
   - Key attributes:
     - cache: Dictionary storing key-value pairs
     - max_size: Maximum cache entries
     - lock: Threading lock for synchronization
   - Methods:
     - `get()`: Thread-safe cache retrieval
     - `set()`: Thread-safe cache insertion with LRU eviction
     - `clear()`: Thread-safe cache clearing

### Key Features

1. **Thread Safety** [Lines: 13-29]

   - Lock-based synchronization
   - Safe concurrent access
   - Protected cache operations

2. **LRU Eviction** [Lines: 18-24]
   - Automatic size management
   - Oldest entry removal
   - Configurable maximum size

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- typing: Type hints
- threading: Concurrency support

### Internal Modules

- None

## Known Issues

1. **Performance Trade-offs**

   - Lock contention under high concurrency
   - Simple LRU implementation may not be optimal
   - No expiration-based eviction

2. **Memory Management**
   - No size-based eviction (only count-based)
   - No memory usage monitoring
   - No automatic cache cleanup

## Performance Considerations

1. **Concurrency**

   - Lock granularity affects throughput
   - Potential bottleneck under high load
   - Thread contention on single lock

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Fixed entry count limit
   - No memory size constraints
   - No compression support

## Security Considerations

1. **Thread Safety**
   - Protected shared state access
   - No data races
   - Resource cleanup on clear

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Locking Strategy**

   - Decision: Single lock for entire cache
   - Rationale: Simple and safe implementation
   - Trade-off: Simplicity vs. fine-grained concurrency

2. **Eviction Policy**

   - Decision: Simple LRU based on insertion order
   - Rationale: Easy to implement and understand
   - Trade-off: Simplicity vs. optimal caching

3. **Cache Size**
   - Decision: Count-based size limit
   - Rationale: Simple to implement and monitor
   - Trade-off: Memory control vs. implementation complexity

## Future Improvements

1. Add size-based eviction policy
2. Implement fine-grained locking
3. Add expiration-based eviction
4. Add memory usage monitoring
5. Support cache statistics tracking
6. Add cache entry compression
7. Implement cache persistence
8. Add cache warming mechanisms
