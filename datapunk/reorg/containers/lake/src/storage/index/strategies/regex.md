# Regex Strategy Module Documentation

## Purpose

This module provides a GiST-based indexing strategy for regular expressions, enabling efficient pattern matching and search operations with optimized performance through pattern analysis and decomposition.

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **RegexPattern Class** [Lines: 7-156]

   - Represents a regular expression pattern with optimization features
   - Key attributes:
     - pattern: Original regex pattern
     - prefix/suffix: Common string literals for quick filtering
     - literals: Required literal strings
     - length bounds: Min/max string length constraints
   - Methods:
     - `from_regex()`: Creates optimized pattern from regex string
     - `matches()`: Checks if text matches pattern
     - `could_match()`: Tests potential pattern intersection

2. **RegexStrategy Class** [Lines: 158-302]

   - Implements GiST predicate strategy for regex indexing
   - Key methods:
     - `consistent()`: Checks entry consistency with query
     - `union()`: Creates union pattern for multiple entries
     - `compress()/decompress()`: Pattern compression
     - `penalty()`: Calculates insertion penalties
     - `pick_split()`: Splits entries for tree balancing

3. **Helper Functions** [Lines: 304-320]
   - `create_regex_index()`: Factory function for regex-based GiST index

### Key Features

1. **Pattern Optimization** [Lines: 18-57]

   - Extracts literal prefixes and suffixes
   - Identifies required literal strings
   - Calculates length bounds
   - Enables early filtering

2. **Efficient Matching** [Lines: 59-93]

   - Quick pre-checks using extracted features
   - Optimized literal matching
   - Full regex matching as last resort

3. **Pattern Analysis** [Lines: 95-156]
   - Pattern intersection detection
   - Case sensitivity handling
   - Length compatibility checks

## Dependencies

### Required Packages

- typing: Type hints
- dataclasses: Data structure decorators
- re: Regular expression operations
- numpy: Numerical operations

### Internal Modules

- gist: GiST index implementation
- GiSTPredicateStrategy: Base strategy class
- GiSTIndex: Index implementation

## Known Issues

1. **Performance Limitations**

   - Complex patterns may still require full regex evaluation
   - Pattern compression is lossy
   - Union operations can create large combined patterns

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Pattern storage overhead for optimization features
   - Union patterns can grow significantly

## Performance Considerations

1. **Optimization Trade-offs**

   - Balances preprocessing cost vs. matching speed
   - Compression threshold affects memory vs. speed
   - Pattern analysis overhead during index creation

2. **Search Efficiency**
   - Quick filtering using literal components
   - Hierarchical pattern matching
   - Early termination for incompatible patterns

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**
   - Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) risks
   - Pattern complexity limits needed
   - Resource consumption monitoring required

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Pattern Analysis**

   - Decision: Extract literal components for optimization
   - Rationale: Enables quick filtering before full regex matching
   - Trade-off: Additional storage vs. improved query performance

2. **Compression Strategy**

   - Decision: Lossy compression for large patterns
   - Rationale: Reduces storage and processing overhead
   - Trade-off: Pattern precision vs. resource usage

3. **GiST Integration**
   - Decision: Implement as GiST predicate strategy
   - Rationale: Leverages tree structure for pattern organization
   - Trade-off: Implementation complexity vs. search efficiency

## Future Improvements

1. Add pattern complexity analysis
2. Implement non-lossy compression options
3. Add support for pattern statistics tracking
4. Optimize union operations for large pattern sets
5. Add pattern validation and sanitization
6. Implement pattern caching mechanisms
