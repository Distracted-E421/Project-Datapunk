## Known Issues

1. **Memory Management** [Lines: 9-39]

   - Fixed buffer sizes
   - No overflow handling
   - Memory pressure risk

2. **Join Performance** [Lines: 136-177]
   - Full window scans
   - Hash table rebuilding
   - Memory intensive

## Performance Considerations

1. **Window Operations** [Lines: 9-39]

   - Window size impact
   - Expiration overhead
   - Buffer maintenance cost

2. **Stream Processing** [Lines: 68-77]
   - Async execution overhead
   - Event handling cost
   - Resource utilization

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**

   - No data encryption
   - No access control
   - Stream isolation needed

2. **Resource Control**
   - No rate limiting
   - Unbounded buffers
   - Resource exhaustion risk

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Buffer Management** [Lines: 9-39]

   - Fixed-size circular buffer
   - Simple expiration policy
   - Memory vs completeness

2. **Processing Model** [Lines: 68-77]

   - Async-first design
   - Event-driven approach
   - Flexibility vs complexity

3. **Window Strategy** [Lines: 79-134]
   - Time-based windows
   - Sliding window model
   - Simplicity vs accuracy
