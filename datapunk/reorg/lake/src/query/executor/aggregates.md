## Known Issues

1. **Memory Usage** [Lines: 54-93]

   - Some functions store all values in memory
   - May be inefficient for large datasets

2. **Performance** [Lines: 179-228]
   - Group-by operations may be memory-intensive
   - Multiple passes required for some calculations

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Efficiency** [Lines: 54-93]

   - Statistical functions store complete datasets
   - Consider streaming algorithms for large datasets

2. **Computation Overhead** [Lines: 179-228]
   - Multiple aggregations increase processing time
   - Group-by operations require memory proportional to unique groups

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**

   - Numeric type casting may raise exceptions
   - Memory consumption should be monitored

2. **Resource Management**
   - Large datasets may exhaust memory
   - Consider implementing resource limits

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

1. **Accuracy vs Performance** [Lines: 54-93]

   - Uses exact calculations over approximations
   - Stores complete datasets for accurate statistics
   - Trade-off between accuracy and memory usage

2. **Flexibility vs Complexity** [Lines: 161-228]

   - Generic aggregation framework adds overhead
   - Supports wide range of functions
   - Complex implementation for better extensibility

3. **Memory vs Streaming** [Lines: 54-93]
   - In-memory calculations for simplicity
   - Could be optimized for streaming in future

## Future Improvements

1. **Streaming Algorithms**

   - Implement memory-efficient statistical calculations
   - Add support for approximate aggregations

2. **Parallel Processing**

   - Add parallel aggregation support
   - Implement distributed aggregations

3. **Additional Functions**
   - Add more statistical functions
   - Implement more window functions
   - Add support for custom aggregations
