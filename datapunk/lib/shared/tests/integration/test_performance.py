"""Performance Integration Test Suite

Tests concurrent operations and system performance across the Datapunk ecosystem:
- Cache operations (Redis)
- Database operations (PostgreSQL)
- Message queue operations (RabbitMQ)
- Resource utilization monitoring

Performance Targets:
- Concurrent operations: 100/sec minimum
- Operation latency: <100ms
- Resource usage: <60% CPU, <2GB RAM

NOTE: Tests require running infrastructure services

FIXME: Improve resource cleanup
