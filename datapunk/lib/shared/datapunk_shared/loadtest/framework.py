"""
Load Testing Framework for Datapunk Services

A flexible framework for conducting load tests across the Datapunk service mesh,
with support for concurrent user simulation, performance metrics collection,
and real-time monitoring. Designed to validate service resilience and
performance under various load conditions.

Key capabilities:
- Concurrent user simulation with configurable ramp-up
- Real-time metrics collection and monitoring
- Integration with service mesh monitoring
- Support for custom test scenarios

See sys-arch.mmd for service mesh integration points and monitoring setup.
