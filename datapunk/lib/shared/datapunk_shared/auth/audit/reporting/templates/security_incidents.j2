{# 
    Security Incidents Report Template
    --------------------------------
    Purpose: Generates a standardized JSON report for security incidents and their remediation actions.
    
    Expected incident object structure:
    - id: Unique identifier for the incident
    - type: Classification of the incident (e.g., "unauthorized_access", "data_breach")
    - severity: Impact level of the incident
    - timestamp: When the incident occurred
    - description: Detailed explanation of the incident
    - status: Current state of the incident (e.g., "open", "resolved")
    - affected_resources: List/object of impacted systems or data
    - actions_taken: Array of remediation steps taken
    
    NOTE: The template uses the tojson filter for affected_resources to ensure proper JSON encoding
    of complex nested structures while maintaining valid JSON output.
