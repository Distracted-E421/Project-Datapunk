"""
Service Mesh Circuit Breaker Strategies

Implements configurable failure detection and recovery strategies for
the Datapunk service mesh circuit breaker system. Provides flexible
reliability patterns adaptable to different service characteristics.

Key features:
- Configurable failure detection
- Adaptive recovery patterns
- State transition management
- Performance impact control
- Metric integration

See sys-arch.mmd Reliability/CircuitBreakerStrategies for implementation details.
