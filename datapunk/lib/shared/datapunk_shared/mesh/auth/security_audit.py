Service Mesh Security Audit System

Provides comprehensive security event logging and analysis for the Datapunk
service mesh. Integrates with Prometheus metrics for real-time security
monitoring and anomaly detection.

Key features:
- Structured security event logging
- Prometheus metric integration
- Event severity classification
- Audit trail persistence
- Performance monitoring

See sys-arch.mmd Security/Audit for compliance and integration details.
