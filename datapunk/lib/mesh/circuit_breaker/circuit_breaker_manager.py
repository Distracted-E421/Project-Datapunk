"""
Service Mesh Circuit Breaker Manager

Coordinates circuit breaker behavior across the Datapunk service mesh,
providing centralized management and monitoring of service reliability
patterns. Enables consistent failure handling across the mesh.

Key features:
- Centralized circuit breaker management
- Dynamic configuration updates
- Cross-service failure correlation
- Real-time state monitoring
- Failure pattern analysis

See sys-arch.mmd Reliability/CircuitBreakerManager for implementation details.
