Health-Aware Load Balancing Strategies for Datapunk Service Mesh

This module provides load balancing algorithms that consider:
- Instance health scores
- Historical performance
- Recovery patterns
- Load distribution

These strategies enable intelligent traffic distribution
while maintaining service reliability and performance.
