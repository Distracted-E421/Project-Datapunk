Load Test Implementations for Datapunk Services

Provides specialized load test implementations for different service types
in the Datapunk mesh. Each implementation focuses on specific service
characteristics while sharing common monitoring and reporting capabilities.

Key test types:
- API endpoint testing (REST/GraphQL)
- Database operation testing
- Cache performance testing
- Message queue testing

See sys-arch.mmd Gateway/Core Services for service integration points.
