## Technical Deep Dive

### Storage Layer Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Cache Layer"
        CL1[ML Warming]
        CL2[Eviction Strategies]
        CL3[Distributed Cache]
    end

    subgraph "Storage Engines"
        SE1[Vector Store]
        SE2[Time Series]
        SE3[Spatial]
    end

    subgraph "Index Management"
        IM1[B-tree/Hash]
        IM2[R-tree]
        IM3[Bitmap]
    end

    CL1 & CL2 --> CL3
    CL3 --> SE1 & SE2 & SE3
    SE1 & SE2 & SE3 --> IM1 & IM2 & IM3
```

### Ingestion Pipeline

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Sources"
        S1[Batch]
        S2[Stream]
        S3[API]
    end

    subgraph "Processing"
        P1[Validation]
        P2[Transform]
        P3[Enrich]
    end

    subgraph "Storage"
        ST1[Cache]
        ST2[Persist]
        ST3[Index]
    end

    S1 & S2 & S3 --> P1 --> P2 --> P3
    P3 --> ST1 --> ST2 --> ST3
```

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Cache Performance

Addressed through:

- Implementation of ML-based prediction (`ml_strategies.py`)
- Optimized eviction policies (`cache_strategies.py`)
- Enhanced distributed coordination (`quorum.py`)

### Challenge 2: Distributed Consistency

Solved using:

- Quorum-based writes
- Versioned data storage
- Conflict resolution strategies

## Next Steps

With a very solid foundation finally in place, the next steps are to complete the remaining 5% of the Lake Service implementation and begin the next phase of development. It is unlikely that the phases will be completed in order, but that is fine. We will continue to focus on completing the highest priority items first. I plan on befor the end of the project window for the class, to atlest get the 3 core data and api modules into a working prototype with a fucntional frontend. I think that it is within reach, though my sleep schedule is not gonna appreicate it. I have really been enjoying the work, and I think that this is worth putting in the blood and pain while its technically my job.

## Conclusion

Week 6 saw substantial progress in both implementation and documentation. The enhanced Mermaid documentation and graph generation system will significantly improve our technical documentation quality. The Lake Service is near completion, with only performance optimization remaining. The github repo also has a new readme finally, so you can actually see what the project is about lol. Also, I added a bit of a guide to get VSCode to render everything the way it looks to me in the editor. Eventually, I will have the time to finish all converting the dedicated ones to .svg, but I digress.

Note: Time estimates are approximate and include research, implementation, testing, and documentation for each component. My sleep schedule is so wack, that I end up practically nocturnal, as the middle of the night and early morning is when i seem to be most productive, and I can work completely uninterrupted. This, as you could imagine, causes an already adhd brain to completely forget how long its been, and what I technically did in that time. Just a disclaimer.
