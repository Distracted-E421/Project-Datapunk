### Integration Patterns

The integration framework implements four primary patterns:

1. **Synchronous Communication**

   - REST APIs for CRUD operations
   - GraphQL for complex queries
   - Direct database access for internal components
2. **Asynchronous Processing**

   - Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
   - Message queues for background processing
   - Streaming data pipelines for continuous data flow
3. **Hybrid Operations**

   - Combined sync/async operations for optimal performance
   - Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Batch processing for large-scale operations
4. **Cross-Service Communication**

   - Service discovery and registration
   - Health checking and circuit breaking
   - Distributed tracing and monitoring

## API Specifications

### RESTful Endpoints

```yaml
api_endpoints:
base_url: "/api/v1/lake"
endpoints:
path: "/data"
methods: [GET, POST, PUT, DELETE]
auth_required: true
rate_limit: 1000/hour
description: "Core data operations endpoint"
use_cases: ["CRUD operations", "Batch processing", "Data querying"]
path: "/import"
methods: [POST]
auth_required: true
max_payload: 5GB
description: "Bulk data import endpoint"
use_cases: ["Data migration", "Batch uploads", "System integration"]
path: "/stream"
methods: [GET]
auth_required: true
streaming: true
description: "Real-time data streaming endpoint"
use_cases: ["Live monitoring", "Real-time analytics", "Event streaming"]
```

### RESTful Endpoints Intent

The RESTful API design follows specific principles and patterns chosen to optimize for both performance and usability:

#### Base URL Structure (`/api/v1/lake`)

- Version prefixing (v1) enables API evolution
- Namespace isolation (lake) prevents endpoint conflicts
- Follows REST best practices for resource naming

#### Core Data Endpoint (`/data`)

- Full CRUD support for maximum flexibility
- Rate limiting (1000/hour) prevents abuse while allowing legitimate use
- Authentication requirement ensures data security
- Chosen rate limit balances security with typical enterprise needs

#### Import Endpoint (`/import`)

- Dedicated endpoint for bulk operations
- 5GB payload limit based on empirical testing

```yaml
performance_metrics:
optimal_chunk_size: 1GB
max_concurrent_uploads: 5
timeout_threshold: 30min
```

- Separate from CRUD to optimize for large data transfers

#### Streaming Endpoint (`/stream`)

- GET method enables WebSocket upgrade
- Authentication ensures secure streaming
- Designed for real-time data access
- Integrates with Datapunk Stream for processing

#### Future Considerations

```yaml
future_enhancements:
endpoints:
path: "/batch"
purpose: "Optimized batch operations"
path: "/sync"
purpose: "Cross-system synchronization"
features:

```

### GraphQL Schema

```graphql
type Query {
  userData(userId: ID!): UserData
  analytics(timeRange: TimeRange!): AnalyticsData
  vectors(type: VectorType!): [Vector!]!
}

type Mutation {
  importData(input: ImportInput!): ImportResult
  updateUserData(userId: ID!, data: UserDataInput!): UserData
  archiveData(criteria: ArchiveCriteria!): ArchiveResult
}
```

### GraphQL Schema Intent

The GraphQL schema design represents a strategic approach to flexible data querying and manipulation within the Datapunk Lake ecosystem. This schema implementation provides a robust interface for both data retrieval and modification operations while maintaining type safety and query efficiency.

The Query type focuses on three core data access patterns:

```yaml
query_patterns:
  user_data:
    - granular_user_access
    - permission_based_filtering
    - efficient_field_selection
  analytics:
    - time_series_analysis
    - aggregated_metrics
    - customizable_reporting
  vector_operations:
    - type_specific_queries
    - similarity_search_support
    - embedding_retrieval
```

The Mutation type implements three essential data modification patterns:

```yaml
mutation_patterns:
  data_import:
    - bulk_operation_support
    - validation_integration
    - progress_tracking
  user_updates:
    - atomic_operations
    - field_level_changes
    - audit_trail_generation
  archival_process:
    - criteria_based_selection
    - compliance_aware_archiving
    - metadata_preservation
```

Future enhancements will include:

```yaml
future_capabilities:
  schema_features:
    - subscription_support
    - federated_queries
    - custom_directives
  optimization:
    - query_complexity_analysis
    - automatic_persisted_queries
    - response_caching
  security:
    - field_level_permissions
    - rate_limiting_directives
    - depth_limiting
```

This GraphQL schema design ensures efficient data access patterns while maintaining flexibility for future expansions and integrations with other Datapunk components. The type system provides a clear contract for data operations while supporting the complex querying needs of modern data lake operations.
