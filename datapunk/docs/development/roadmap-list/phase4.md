## Security Considerations

### Critical Areas

- Token encryption at rest
- Secure key storage
- Session timeout management
- Rate limiting implementation
- Audit log security
- Cross-site request forgery protection
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Points

- Token validation caching
- Session storage optimization
- Audit log buffering
- Background token cleanup

## Known Issues

1. Token Management

   - Need implementation of token binding
   - Cross-service propagation needs optimization

2. Session Handling

   - Redis cluster support pending
   - Session analytics need implementation

3. OAuth Integration

   - PKCE support pending
   - State management needs enhancement

4. Audit Logging
