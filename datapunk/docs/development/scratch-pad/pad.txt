Is this everything we need in broad strokes for this phase of documentation,  or are we feeling like its kinda light, in an incomplete sorta way, and we need more details or features are missing @Codebase @sys-arch.mmd 

lets rewrite all of that to add to phase \ of our current @ROADMAP.md

using our new @ROADMAP.md for phase /, lets rewrite the checklist here in @  with as much detail as possible.

Evaluate the current state of the roadmap, focusing on the completeness of the highlighted phase. What features are missing? What components are not accounted for? What services need to be integrated or does this service need to be implmented elsewhere? The goal is to have a comprehensive idea of what an implemntation of the highlited phase's service/module would look like. @Codebase @sys-arch.mmd 

@ROADMAP.md rewrite what you just wrote to add (not nuke or remove) to the phase in question. Use the @NESTED_CODEBLOCKS.md for reference incase the formating is an issue.
