Composer History, @Lint Errors, VS Code 1.93.1

Composer history lets you access previous composer sessions after restart. You can
also edit and resubmit from previous messages within a session.
We have made slight improvements to Debug with AI and added back @Lint Errors in
Chat.
VS Code 1.93.1: Cursor is now based on VS Code 1.93.1.
Python auto import for Cursor Tab is much more stable in this release.
Switching models is a lot easier with model search (Cmd-option-/) in the chat,
composer, and cmd-k input boxes.
Composer now only applies files that are in context to prevent hallucinations.
Using  cursor .  with WSL should now be more stable.

1/59

UPDATE (0.42.1 - 0.42.5): Fixes the following upstream security issue: CVE-2024-43601.
Also fixes a few composer bugs and a bug with Cursor Tab. Allows composer to auto apply
to files not in its context. Also includes additional mitigations to CVE-2024-48919. Reduces a
few long-tail connection errors. Adds escape hatch when Claude predicts the wrong filepath
in chat.

Faster Copilot++, Claude

Faster Copilot++: We've made Copilot++ ~2x faster! This speed bump comes from a
new model / faster inference. ~50% of users are already on this model, and it will roll
out to everyone over a few days. If you'd like to enable the model immediately, you can
control your model in the bottom bar of the editor.
Stable Claude Support: All the newest Claude models are available for Pro and API
key users. Head to Settings > Models to toggle them on. Pro users get 10 requests /
day for free and can keep using Claude at API-key prices for subsequent requests.
Team invites: We made it a bit easier for you to invite your colleagues to your Cursor
team. You can send these from the editor's settings or at cursor.com/settings.
Admin improvements: Team admins can now mark themselves as unpaid users and
can see the last time team members used the product.
New Settings: We moved all our settings to be accessible by the gear in the top right.
No more "More" tab!

Mar 12, 2024

7/59

Claude Support

If you’re a Pro or Business user, you can add "claude-3-opus" as a custom model in the
Settings page and use 10 fast requests per day for free (unlimited slow, but the delay
increases exponentially).

We expect to roll out a more permanent solution (including API key users) very soon.

@Web, gpt-4-0125-preview

Using @Web in chat will give the AI the ability to crawl the web! The tools it can use include
a search engine and a documentation site crawler.

10/59

This feature is still experimental. We're very interested in improving the ability of the AI to
understand external libraries, and your thoughts will help us improve :).

Both pro and API key users can also try out gpt-4-0125-preview by configuring the model
under Settings > OpenAI API > Configure Models. We’re testing the new model right now for
pro users to see if it performs better than all older versions of gpt-4. If so, will roll out as the
default experience.

New Model, Apply Button v2

"cursor-fast": This is a new model available in command-k and chat. Expect it to be a
bit smarter than gpt-3.5, and with many fewer formatting errors.
Apply button: We've added some polish to the "apply codeblock" experience in chat.
Chat lints: If the AI suggests a code change in chat that involves a made up code
symbol, we'll underline it. Availble for Python, Typescript, Rust.
More chat symbol links: When the chat references a  code symbol , you'll often be able
to click directly to it.

UPDATE (0.23.3-0.23.9): Fixes to Command-K, changelog auto-opening, editing very long

Indexing, cmd-k in terminal, @git, /edit, bugfixes

1. Indexing should now be faster, more stable, and use less of your system resources.
You can also configure ignored files in a  .cursorignore . The controls are in the
"More" tab.

2. Cmd-k is now in the terminal! A bit hackily implemented, but surprisingly useful.
3. Ask about git commits and PRs using @git in chat!
4. Use /edit in the chat to edit a whole file (if less than 400 lines). Expect the edits to be
fast and GPT-4-quality. This uses non-public models, and is for now only available to
users who do not use their own API key.

5. Bugfixes! Fixed the "ejected from slow mode" UI, added auto-switching logic for the

model type when switching on API, improved @ symbol speed, fixed Windows
keycommand to be Ctrl-Shift-Y instead of Ctrl-Y, and more.

Better Docs Management, Staged Rollouts

Docs

The main addition in this update is better docs support. This means you can add and remove
docs and inspect the urls that are actually being used for each doc you have uploaded. You'll
also be able to see what webpages end up being shown to GPT-4 to provide you an answer.

You can also paste a url into the chat and the model will automatically include it in the
context being used. Teams can also share private docs.

Staged Rollouts

26/59

Following this update, future updates should come as staged rollouts. This will mean greater
guarantees of stability and more frequent updates.

Long files in chat

We continued to improve the experience of chatting with large files. If you @ multiple files
that are too large to fit in GPT-4's context window, we'll intelligently pick the most relevant
chunks of code to show to show the model.

Bug fixes:

Copy Paste chat text form Jupyter
Some chat focus issues
UI tweaks
Better state management - prevents crashes from editor using too much memory

get a long completion from gpt-4.

Experimental: interface agent!

This nightly build comes with experimental interface agent support!

42/59

The goal: you write an interface specification, and an agent writes both the tests and the
implementation for you. It makes sure that the tests pass, so you don't even need to look at
the implementation at all.

We think this may enable a new kind of programming, that's kind of different to what we're all
used to. Please experiment with it and let us know your thoughts in the Discord channel.

How to use it:

1. It only works in Typescript with vitest or mocha as test runners right now.
2. Hit Cmd-Shift-I, and give your new interface a name.
3. Write the methods you want your interface to have.
4. Hit Cmd-Shift-Enter, and the AI will write the interface for you!

Jul 3, 2023

New inline edits

Cmd+K's UI has been changed: it's in-editor, "sticky," and @-symbol-compatible. We hope it
helps you stay in flow and more quickly iterate on your prompts. (Also, you can now use
up/down arrows for history in chat.)

Also, Cursor's AI will now use popular documentation to improve the answers to your
questions. For example, if you ask it "how do I grab all s3 buckets with boto3?" it will search
over the boto3 docs to find the answer. To add your own documentation or explicitly
reference existing docs, type '@library_name' in chat.

Bug fixes:

1. Long code selections no longer brick the editor
2. Auto-fixing errors no longer brings up the problems view (in particular, this fixes an

annoying bug if you have auto-fix on save turned on)

We've transitioned to building Cursor on top of a fork of VSCodium, moving away from
our previous Codemirror-based approach.
This allows us to focus on AI features while leveraging VSCode's mature text editing
capabilities.
Our goal is to create an IDE optimized for pair-programming with AI.
While currently similar to a standard code editor with AI features, we plan to evolve the
programming experience significantly over time.
