Abstract

General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems are built on massive swathes of
public web data, assembled into corpora such as C4, RefinedWeb, and Dolma. To
our knowledge, we conduct the first, large-scale, longitudinal audit of the consent
protocols for the web domains underlying AI training corpora. Our audit of 14, 000
web domains provides an expansive view of crawlable web data and how codified
data use preferences are changing over time. We observe a proliferation of AI-
specific clauses to limit use, acute differences in restrictions on AI developers, as
well as general inconsistencies between websites’ expressed intentions in their
Terms of Service and their robots.txt. We diagnose these as symptoms of ineffective
web protocols, not designed to cope with the widespread re-purposing of the internet
for AI. Our longitudinal analyses show that in a single year (2023-2024) there has
been a rapid crescendo of data restrictions from web sources, rendering ~5%+ of
all tokens in C4, or 28%+ of the most actively maintained, critical sources in C4,
fully restricted from use. For Terms of Service crawling restrictions, a full 45% of
C4 is now restricted. If respected or enforced, these restrictions are rapidly biasing
the diversity, freshness, and scaling laws for general-purpose AI systems. We hope
to illustrate the emerging crises in data consent, for both developers and creators.
The foreclosure of much of the open web will impact not only commercial AI, but
also non-commercial AI and academic research.

Introduction

The web has become the primary communal source of data, or “data commons”, for general-purpose
and multi-modal AI systems. The scale and heterogeneity of web-sourced training datasets provide
the foundation for both open and closed AI systems, such as OLMo [42], GPT-4o [85], and Gemini
[115]. However, the use of web content for AI poses ethical and legal challenges to data consent,
attribution, copyright, and the potential impact on creative industries [35, 62, 94, 128]. This has
spurred new initiatives to better verify data quality and provenance [34, 32, 55, 66, 11], isolate public

domain and permissively licensed data [77], and integrate new infrastructure to signal [31], detect
[112], and even evade the use of data for AI training [108].

The focus of this work is to understand the evolving role of the internet as a primary ingredient to AI,
and how AI has collided with the limited protocols that govern data use. Web data is traditionally
collected using web crawlers—automatic bots that systematically explore the internet and record
what they see. However, the mechanisms for indicating restrictions to web crawlers, such as the
Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP), were not designed with AI in mind [92]. The REP is referred to
as robots.txt in practice. As such, we examine their (in)ability to communicate the nuances in how
content creators wish their work to be used, if at all, for AI. And more broadly, we analyze how AI is
already re-shaping the culture of web consent, and how this is shifting the landscape for AI training
data. Our results foretell significant changes not only to AI data collection practices and data scaling
laws, but also the structure of consent on the open web, which will impact more than AI developers.

To this end, we present a large-scale audit of the web sources underlying three open AI training
corpora: C4 [98], RefinedWeb [90], and Dolma [111]. In contrast to prior audits that assess datasets—
curated snapshots of data—this work looks beneath the datasets at the web domains they were derived
from, and traces the temporal evolution of these sources. We are, to our knowledge, the first to
systematically measure detailed provenance, crawler consent mechanisms, and content monetization
factors, all relevant to the responsible downstream use of this data. These analyses enable us to trace
fundamental distribution shifts in how preference signals are expressed and the inadequacy of existing
tools. Our work has several key findings:

1. A proliferation of restrictions on the AI data commons. We find a rapid proliferation of
restrictions on web crawlers associated with AI development in both websites’ robots.txt
and Terms of Service. We estimate, in on year (2023-04 to 2024-04), ~25%+ of tokens from
the most critical domains, and ~5%+ of tokens from the entire corpora of C4, RefinedWeb,
and Dolma have since become restricted by robots.txt. Forecasting these trends forward
shows a decline in unrestricted, open web data year-over-year.

2. Consent asymmetries & inconsistencies. OpenAI’s crawlers are significantly more re-
stricted than those of other AI developers. More broadly, preference signaling mechanisms
like robots.txt see errors and omissions in their coverage across AI developers, as well as
contradictions with their terms of services—indicating inefficiencies in the tools used to
communicate data intentions.

3. A divergence in content characteristics between the head and tail of public web-crawled
training corpora. We find the largest web-based sources of public training corpora have
significantly higher rates of user content, multi-modal content, and monetized content, but
only slightly less sensitive/explicit content. Top web domains comprise news, encyclopedias,
and social media sites, as compared to the many organization websites, blogs, and e-
commerce websites in the long tail of web sources.

4. A mismatch between web data and common uses of conversational AI. We contrast
data web sources with the real-world usage of conversational AI—showing how substantial
portions of web-derived training data may be misaligned with the tasks that AI models are
actually used for. These results may have implications for model alignment, future data
collection practices, and copyright.

2 Methodology

AI models that are highly performant on tasks in language [98], images [132, 37, 4], video [7, 76, 79],
and even audio [64, 26] increasingly depend on massive web-sourced training datasets. These datasets
are collected using web crawlers—agents that navigate the web, accessing and retrieving web pages
without human intervention. While these robots are essential for a variety of applications, including
search engines, studying the internet (ie archiving), and link verification tools; recently they have also
become the backbone of AI training data collection [97, 16].

In our study, we focus on three popular, open-source, and permissively licensed data sources which
are derived from Common Crawl, the largest publicly available crawl of the web, which has collected
and stored hundreds of billions of web pages since 2008. For each web-based data source, we sample
the web domains from which it was created, and extensively human annotate their properties. Our

DATA SOURCE

CRAWL DATES

Data sources The data sources used for
our study are C4 [98], RefinedWeb [90], and
Dolma [111]. These data sources each have
100k-1M+ downloads, are the primary com-
ponent in most modern foundation models
[16, 42, 14], as well as being widely used to
derive other popular datasets [130, 118, 116].
Common Crawl is released on a monthly ba-
sis, and, as see in Table 1, each data source is
based on a different set of monthly snapshots. Each of these corpora apply various automatic filtering
techniques, including removing duplicative pages, low-quality content, and personal identifiable
information such as addresses.

Head sample and random sample For each data source, we identified and selected the top 2k web
domains ranked by their number of tokens. We refer to the resulting 3.95k union of these web domains
as HEADAll. This sample represents the largest, most actively maintained, and critical domains for AI
training. For certain analyses, we consider only the head of C4, which we will refer to as HEADC4.

We are also interested in how consent preferences have evolved within a wider sample of internet
domains. To capture this, we randomly sampled 10K domains (RANDOM10k) from the intersection
of the three corpora, totalling 10,136,147 domains. From the 10k sample, we selected a random
subset of 2K for human annotation (RANDOM2k). RANDOM10k was sampled from the intersection of
domains listed across all three datasets, which means this subset may skew towards more widely-used
or high-quality domains.

Human annotations We trained annotators to manually label the websites for their content modali-
ties (e.g. video, text); website purpose(s) (e.g. news, e-commerce); presence of paywalls and embed-
ded advertisements; the text of the terms of service, if any; and other metadata detailed in Table 2.
Annotators received individual instructions, frequent quality calibration, and were compensated well
above industry standards at $25-$30 per hour. We collected annotations for the entirety of HEADAll
as well as from the random sample RANDOM2k. More details on our annotation process are available
in Appendix A, and all annotations will be made publicly available for reproducibility and future
research.

Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons

Measuring website administrators’ intentions A goals of our audit is to measure website admin-
istrators’ intentions for how their site can be crawled and its content used—including for training
AI models. We used the Wayback Machine1, a digital archive of 835 billion web pages, to collect
historical versions of each website’s homepage, its Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP), commonly
referred to as robots.txt file, and its terms of service page. This was collected at monthly intervals,
from January 2016 to April 2024.

The REP, first introduced in 1995 and codified in 2022, has become the default mechanism for website
owners to indicate to web crawlers what parts of their website, if any, they consent to have crawled
[54]. While it is not legally enforceable, it is respected by all major search engines, as it prevents
website servers from getting overloaded by crawlers, it allows websites to signal pages that are
undesirable to crawl (for example, calendar sites that could lead to infinite loops), and by respecting
it, crawlers disincentivize adversarial tactics designed to impede crawlers. Website creators are able
to set one set of instructions for all web crawlers or a different instructions for each web crawler.
For instance, Google Search respects instructions which specifies the user agent “Googlebot” while
Common Crawl listens to the user agent “CCBot.”

In our audit, we record the robots.txt instructions for a range of crawlers, but focus our analysis on
five AI developers, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, and Meta, as well as non-profit web archival
organizations such as Common Crawl and the Internet Archive, which have seen their data taken
for AI training. Collectively, we refer to these as “AI Organizations”. We classify robots.txt for each
crawler in ascending order of restrictions, from no robots.txt present, to sitemaps which support
crawlers without limitations, to basic restrictions on a subset of directories, to full restrictions on any
crawling of the website. For each corpus, we measure the percentage of “restricted tokens” as the
portion of tokens from web domains that fully restrict one or more of the AI Organizations’s crawlers.
For Terms of Service analysis, we define restricted tokens to simply mean the portion of unusable
tokens due to terms that preclude crawling or AI. See Appendix B.2 for the full list of agents and
Appendix B.1 for the robots.txt restriction classification taxonomy.

In addition to robots.txt, we recorded the Terms of Service (ToS) and other content and copyright
policies for each website. These documents support more nuanced preferences than the REP, and
allow for blanket bans on downstream use cases rather than just specification of what data agents
are allowed to collect. We used an automatic annotation pipeline (see Appendix B for details) to
categorize ToS agreements according to stance towards use of web crawlers and AI training, content
use restrictions, and non-compete clauses, in ascending degrees of restrictiveness.

3 Findings

3.1 The Rise of Restrictions on Open Web Data

To understand the web sources underlying foundation models, we analyze the longitudinal changes
in robots.txt and Terms of Service restrictions between January 2016 and April 2024. In Figure 1
the plots depict the percent of tokens present in each category of restriction over time, for the AI
Organizations in HEADC4—the largest, most actively maintained, and critical domains for AI training.
The fine-grained longitudinal analysis of robots and Terms of Service trends allows us to estimate this
time series into the future. We apply Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)
models to generate forecasts of future trends for both the head sample and random subset, the
details of which can be found in Appendix C along with the coefficients and tests.

In Figure 2 we measure the restricted tokens, or how many tokens fall into the most restrictive
settings for each of robots.txt and Terms of Service, as a portion of the Full Corpus, or HEADAll. The
intermittent lack of smoothness for Figures 2c and 2d is mainly due to temporal gaps in the Wayback
Machine; however the main trends remain visible. In all analyses we exclude web domains which
could not be retrieved from the Wayback Machine, and all proportions are based on the set of web
domains which existed in that time period.

These analyses show a clear and systematic rise in restrictions to crawl and train on data, from across
the webs. We make no assertion regarding whether the prior omission of a robots.txt or restrictions
implies consent to use data. To the degree these restrictions are respected, it also foretells a decline

in open data, which may impact more than commercial AI developers, or even AI organizations in
general. We break down and discuss the findings of this temporal analysis below.

Web domains are adopting robots.txt and Terms of Service pages to signal preferences. Fig-
ure 1(Top & Middle) shows from 2016, the portion of web domains in HEADC4 without a robots.txt
and Terms of Service has gone from 20% and 80% respectively, to near zero.2 This reflects an
emerging adoption of these practices to signal and protect data intentions.

Robots.txt crawling restrictions have risen precipitously since mid-2023. Figure 1(Top) shows
the rapid re-distribution of robots.txt restrictions, directly after the introduction of GPTBot and
Google-Extended crawler agents. This re-distribution to full restrictions mainly comes from websites
with previously moderate restrictions, such as disallowed directories, pattern-based or search page
restrictions, and partly from websites with no prior restrictions in their robots.txt.

Across the entire corpora, ~1% of C4, RefinedWeb, and Dolma tokens were restricted in mid 2023, as
compared to 5-7% of tokens in April 2024. Among the most critical domains (HEADAll), 20-33% of
all tokens are restricted, as compared to <3% one year prior (Figure 2a). From a relative perspective,
from 2023-4 to 2024-4 these restrictions have risen 500%+ for both C4 and RefinedWeb’s full corpus,

and 1000%+ for both C4 and RefinedWeb’s head distributions. Note that these measurements only
capture full restricted domains, and the numbers are higher for partially restricted domains.

AI developers are restricted at widely varying degrees. Figure 1(Lower) breaks down the restric-
tions by AI developers and non-profit organizations. OpenAI crawlers are restricted for 25.9% of
tokens in HEADC4, followed by Anthropic and Common Crawl (13.3%), Google’s AI crawler (9.8%),
and more distantly Cohere (4.9%), Meta (4.1%), the Internet Archive (3.2%), and lastly Google
Search’s crawler (1.0%). These asymmetries in restrictions have significant differences, and tend to
advantage less widely known AI developers. In Subsection 3.2 we discuss these asymmetries and
their consequences in more depth.

Terms of Service pages have imposed more anti-crawling and now anti-AI restrictions. Fig-
ure 1(Middle) illustrates this gradual re-composition of Terms pages—with web domains shifting
from no terms pages, to those with restrictions on crawling, commercial-use, using the data for
competing services, or re-distribution. Only in 2024 do we see the wider emergence of Terms which
specifically mention and restrict the use of their data for generative AI. In the last year, we’ve seen
a 26-53% relative increase in Terms of Service crawling restrictions across C4, RefinedWeb, and
Dolma. Figure 2c shows 45-55% of all tokens in these three corpora have a form of data use restriction
in their Terms pages. In practice, most automatic crawlers do not heed these Terms, though they may
provide some avenue of legal enforcement3

AI restrictions are driven primarily by news, forums, and social media websites. For robots.txt,
Figure 2b shows nearly 45% of all News website tokens are fully restricted in HEADAll, as compared
to 3% in 2023. For Terms of Service, Figure 2d shows News website tokens have had a 6% rise in the
restricted portion since 2023. Paired with the findings in Table 2, this suggests that the composition
of tokens in crawls respecting robots.txt may shift away from news, social media, and forums, and
towards organization and e-commerce websites.

Forecasting trends in the future suggest a continued and significant decline in open and con-
senting web data sources. SARIMA forecasts suggest that for just the next year (by April 2025) an
additional absolute 2-4% of C4, RefinedWeb, and Dolma tokens will be fully restricted by robots.txt.

Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons

Figure 3: A cross tabulation of the Terms of Service policies and robots.txt restrictions for HEADC4,
measured in percentage of tokens. We find two ways of expressing restrictions on data use for AI
frequently disagree, both in what they express, and can express.

Equivalently, an additional 7-11% of the highest quality tokens in the head distribution will become
restricted. The forecasts for Terms of Service are even starker, with the restricted tokens in the full
corpus expected to rise an absolute 6-10% by April 2025. These trends illustrate a systematic rise
in restrictions on data sources, which, where enforced or respected, will severely hamper the data
scaling practices in the coming years—which have thus forth been responsible for the remarkable
capability improvements.

3.2

Inconsistent and Ineffective Communication on AI Consent

In many cases, data holders fail to effectively communicate their preferences on how their data is used
by AI systems. We observe robots.txt instructions which allow some AI organizations to crawl while
restricting others, references to non-existent crawlers, and contradictions between the robots.txt and
Terms of Service. Together, these issues point to the need for better preference signaling protocols.

REST. (%)

ORGANIZATION

Some AI crawlers are allowed, while others are not.
We find not all AI agents are disallowed equally. In Table 3
we estimate the conditional probabilities of each organi-
zation’s crawler being restricted, conditioned on whether
any other AI organization is restricted. Whereas OpenAI
and Common Crawl agents are frequently disallowed (in
91.5% and 83.4% of cases where any of the organiza-
tions are disallowed), the agents of other AI companies,
such as Google, Cohere, and Meta are often omitted from
robots.txt. The omissions of Cohere, Meta, and other small
AI organizations are likely because website administrators
are unaware or unable to update their robots.txt to reflect
the full list of AI developers. On the other hand, the partic-
ularly high omission rates of Internet Archive and Google
Search suggest web administrators may be open to more
traditional crawler uses like archiving and search engines,
even as they seek to restrict AI usage. A full confusion
matrix showing the correlation between restrictions for each user agent is provided in Appendix
Figure 5.

Unrecognized crawler agents cause incorrect specifications. We find several instances where
robots.txt refer to user agents that the companies do not recognize. For instance, 4.5% of websites
disallowed the unrecognized user agents ANTHROPIC-AI or CLAUDE-WEB (documented as FALSE
ANTHROPIC), but not the documented agent for Anthropic’s crawler, CLAUDEBOT. The origin and
reason for these unrecognized agents remains unclear—Anthropic reports no ownership of these.
These inconsistencies and omissions across AI agents suggest that a significant burden is placed on the
domain creator to understand evolving agent specifications across (a growing number of) developers.
AI crawler standardization could address these challenges in consent/preference signaling.

Contradictions exist between robots.txt and ToS. The Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP) is a
guideline for web crawlers, while a website’s Terms of Service is a legal agreement between the

Table 4: Mean incidence rates of web source features across C4, RefinedWeb, and Dolma. We
measure incidence rates for the top 100, 500, and 2000 URLs, ranked by number of tokens, as well
as the random sample. The ‘Diff’ column reports the % difference between the top 2k and random
samples. We test for significant differences between the overall corpus and each of the top-100,
top-500 and top-2000 sets with a Bonferroni-corrected two-sided permutation test, where differences
significant at the Bonferroni-corrected 5σ level are indicated in bold. We also estimate the percentage
of tokens in each corpus, C4, RefinedWeb, and Dolma, for which the web feature is present (± 95%
bootstrap CI shown in gray), by computing the final percentage of tokens based on the estimate for
the unobserved population (from the random sample), and the observed head sample.

website and users of the site. The benefit of the REP is its machine-readability. However, its rigid
structure, created in 1995, limits what signals it can convey. In contrast, a ToS can communicate rich
and nuanced policies in natural language. Without a robots.txt, a ToS lacks practical deterrence of
unwanted crawling. Inversely, without a ToS, a robots.txt may lack any plausible enforcement [107].
We found that in many cases, websites’ robots.txt implementations fails to capture the intentions
specified in their Terms of Service.

In Figure 3, we illustrate the distribution of Terms and REP use criteria (the taxonomy is defined
in Table 2 and broken down in detail in Appendix B). Common use criteria expressed in modern
ToS pages include prohibitions specifically on commercial use, conditional use limiting actions such
as third-party re-posting, non-compete criteria, or specific prohibitions only against “AI”, but not
against crawling for search engines. We also see many websites write anti-crawling terms but have no
robots.txt file (35.1%), or have no ToS but a restrictive robots.txt (20.3%) that disallows at least some
crawlers. Terms specifying only non-commercial uses are also often paired with fully or partially
restrictive robots.txt files, which may unintentionally limit academic web crawlers, as a side effect of
deterring corporate use. Another formidable challenge is that websites currently have to list every
search engine or AI user agent they want to restrict. Empirical evidence from both Figure 5 and
Figure 3 suggests the absence of REP expressivity and standardization for AI is leading to inconsistent
or unintended signals that fail to reflect intended preferences.

3.3 Correlating Features of Web Data

What does web data actually look like? Prior work has measured the characteristics of web-derived
datasets, for the presence of artifacts [34, 66], undesirable text and images [69, 11], demographic
biases [32], and quality discrepancies across languages [22]. We expand upon these analyses by
measuring what web data sources look like before they have been neatly processed into AI training

Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons

datasets. We measure the presence of multi-modal content, user-derived content, website monetization
schemes, and sensitive content on the most well-represented web domains on the internet (HEADAll)
and on a random sample of domains (RANDOM2k). We also annotate the services provided and
purpose of each web domain.

Most of the web is comprised of organizational/personal websites, and blogs, however the head
distribution is disproportionately news, forums, and encyclopedias. Table 4 shows several notable
and statistically significant differences between head distribution (HEADAll) and tail distribution
(RANDOM2k) of web domains. HEADAll is comprised mostly of news, and social media/forums,
and encyclopedias (72.9%), in contrast to the long tail data in RANDOM2k, which is dominated by
personal or organization websites, blogs and E-commerce sites (97%). Academic and government
content is also proportionately higher in the head distribution. Note however that though they are all
derived from Common Crawl snapshots, C4, RefinedWeb, and Dolma, all show variations in their
source compositions—highlighting the importance of curation choices.

The head distribution of domains is more multimodal, and heavily monetized. We observe
that HEADAll web domains are much more heavily monetized through ads (+47.5%) and paywalls
(+24.1%). Accordingly, they also have significantly greater restrictions from both robots.txt (+22.5%)
and Terms of Service (+35.3%). This monetization and restrictions likely correspond to the higher
quality and heterogeneity of content usually produced by news, periodicals, forums, and databases
which are more common in HEADAll. This is reflected by the higher proportions of image (+4.4%),
video (+39.8%), and audio content (+38.4%) than the rest of the web. Interestingly, the fraction of
user-generated content and sensitive content between the head and tail distributions is less pronounced.
Crawlers that respect the restrictions that occur far more frequently in HEADAll will increasingly lose
access to the most multi-modal, highly curated, and up-to-date content sources.

3.4 Misalignment between Real-world AI Usage and Web Data

In this section, we measure the degree of alignment between real world uses of ChatGPT and the
content in the webcrawls that form the bulk of AI training. For each web domain in HEADAll, we had
annotators label the services provided by the website, as well as the presence of some monetization,
such as a paywall or automatic ads. We compare these services against the services that real-world
users solicit in their interactions with conversational AI systems. We use WildChat, a recent set of 1
million user conversations with ChatGPT [131], collected through a HuggingFace Space wrapper
around OpenAI services. We randomly sampled 100 conversation logs from WildChat, which the
paper authors manually clustered by the type of tasks or goals conveyed by each conversation, with
the goal of relating the core function of these conversations with the services provided by the websites
crawled in training. Subsequently, we used GPT-4o to label 1k randomly selected conversations
from the WildChat dataset; these conversations were labelled using the taxonomy we developed
to categorize websites. Further details on the taxonomy and labelling procedure can be found in
Appendix B.6.

Apparent uses of ChatGPT are misaligned with the popular web domains language models
are trained on. Figure 4(a) shows the distribution of services provided by the web domains, broken
down by whether those domains are monetized. In contrast, Figure 4(b) shows how ChatGPT is used
in the real world. The way that users interact with ChatGPT is different in important ways from the
types of content that is most frequently represented in publicly available web-based training datasets.
For instance, in over 30% of conversations, users request creative compositions such as fictional
story writing or continuation, role-playing, or poetry. However, creative writing is poorly represented
among the web data used for model training. These results may provide evidence for where models
trained exclusively on unstructured internet data are most “unaligned” with how real users want to use
generative AI [87]. Language models trained only on web data are known to struggle to understand
the structure of discourse and underperform models trained with instruction finetuning and preference
training on highly curated data [124, 6, 27]. The misalignment between real use cases and web
crawled data may suggest the key areas of model distributional misalignment, as well as inform future
data collection efforts based on real-world uses.

Sexual role-play appears to be a prevalent use of ChatGPT, despite being mostly removed
from common public datasets. Whereas sensitive (e.g. sexual) content represents < 1% of the web
domains in HEADC4 (see Table 4), sexual role-play represents 12% of all recorded user interactions in
WildChat. All the public datasets we consider—C4, RefinedWeb, and Dolma—have undergone some

Figure 4: The most common services provided by web domains in HEADC4 do not match real
ChatGPT use cases from WildChat user logs. Left: We measure the proportion of tokens in

form of filtering to remove illegal or sexually explicit content, as training on such content introduces
potential liability concerns; the web, in general, is known to have high portions of sexually explicit
content [11, 83]. OpenAI states in the GPT-4 technical report that it also filtered its training data for
harmful content [84]. In addition to filtering web-derived training data, OpenAI’s models are further
trained to refuse requests that violate OpenAI’s Usage Policies.4. OpenAI’s Usage Policies prohibit
“sexually explicit or suggestive content” with respect to minors, or re-distribution that may harm
others; however, there is ambiguity as to whether this would cover all user requests for sexual role-
play [52]. For instance, the GPT-4 technical report makes a distinction in model refusal instructions
between erotic and non-erotic sexual content, “(e.g. literary or artistic value) and contextualized
sexual content (e.g. medical)” [84].

Sexual-related uses of AI are a topic of ongoing debate within the scientific community [53, 82, 119],
and rules differ by company, service, and jurisdiction. In a review of 30 generative AI developers’
acceptable use policies, Klyman [52] finds that OpenAI’s policies are not among the most restrictive
with respect to sexual content; while OpenAI has a blanket ban on “sexually explicit or suggestive
content,” other companies’ acceptable use policies also explicitly prohibit “erotic content,” “adult
content,” “pornography,” “nudity,” and “sexual fetishes” [3, 41, 1]. However, harsher restrictions on
sexual content come with tradeoffs, as more heavily safety-tuned language models may then be less
able to direct users to resources about sex education or generate fictional stories with PG-13 type
content.

Common ChatGPT uses appear distinct from the uses of commercialized web sources. Figure 4
shows that a significant portion of tokens in HEADC4 are from web domains with ads, paywalls, or
both—in other words they are the most commercialized. However, while news websites (the mostly
highly commercialized category) comprise nearly 40% of all tokens in HEADC4, fewer than 1% of
ChatGPT queries appear to be related to news or current affairs. It also shows that news websites have
the highest instance of ads, paywalls, or both—in other words, they are the most commercialized.
Our observations suggest that real-world use cases of ChatGPT are not necessarily directly related to
the most prevalent, commercialized content on the web. This finding has interesting implications for
the use of AI in industries with web-based services, such as journalism, or for US copyright analysis,
which evaluates how the secondary use of a protected work (training AI models) affects the potential
market for the original use of the work (see 17 U.S.C §107).

We believe our observations provide strong empirical evidence for the (mis)alignment between AI
uses and web-derived training data. However, our observations come with significant caveats. The
WildChat [131] dataset may not include a representative sample of how people interact with language
models. Not only does it solely include conversations with a specific instance ChatGPT, but the
WildChat proxy service is hosted on a technical website, HuggingFace Spaces, which could suggest a
more technical user base, or one more likely to audit ChatGPT for inappropriate uses. Model uses
also change both by time and product; our analysis is specific to the model interactions collected in
WildChat between April 9, 2023, at 12 AM to May 1, 2024, using the GPT3.5-Turbo and GPT-4
APIs. Different AI products are likely to have different use distributions, and usage patterns will
inevitably change over time. Finally, the use taxonomy, both for web domains and WildChat uses,
were developed based on a manual, iterative process that is limited in its granularity. It is possible that

data/information from News web domains could be used in responses for non-News classifications
in WildChat, e.g. General Information. This would be exceedingly difficult to measure, and merits
analysis in future work.

4 Discussion

The web-sourced AI data commons is rapidly becoming more restricted. The web has acted
as the primary “data commons” for general-purpose AI. It’s scale and heterogeneity have become
fundamental to advances in capabilities. However, our results show web domains are rapidly restricting
crawling and use of their content for AI. In less than a year, ~5% of the tokens in C4 and other
major corpora have recently become restricted by robots.txt. And nearly 45% of these tokens now
carry some form of restrictions from the domain’s Terms of Service. If these rising restrictions
are respected by model developers (as many claim to) or is legally enforced, the availability of
high-quality pretraining sources will rapidly diminish.

The rise in restrictions will skew data representativity, freshness, and scaling laws. Prior work
has forefronted scaling data as essential to frontier model capabilities [46, 120]. While the declining
trend in consent will protect content creators’ intentions, it would also challenge these data scaling
laws [46, 120]. Not only would these restrictions reduce the scale of available data, but also the
composition (away from news and forums), diversity, and representativeness of training data—biasing
this data toward older content and less fresh content.

Recently, multiple AI developers have been accused of bypassing robots.txt opt-outs to scrape
publisher websites [88, 73]. While it is not possible to confirm, in each case it appears AI systems
may be distinguishing between crawling data for training, and crawling data to retrieve information
for user questions at inference time. One of the few, OpenAI has two crawler agents, GPTBot for
training, and ChatGPT-User for live browsing plugins (see Table 5). Other companies may simply not
be registering their inference time crawlers for opt-outs. This circumvention may allow developers to
directly attribute the retrieved web pages, as well as better achieve data representativity, freshness,
and approximate the scaling laws had they trained on it. However, creators may feel this violates the
spirit of the opt-outs, especially if the opportunity to attribute sources is not taken.

The web needs better protocols to express intentions and consent. The REP places an immense
burden on website owners to correctly anticipate all agents who may crawl their domain for undesired
downstream use cases. We consistently find this leads to protocol implementations that don’t reflect
intended preferences. An alternative scheme might give website owners control over how their
webpages are used rather than who can use them. This would involve standardizing a taxonomy that
better represents downstream use cases, e.g. allowing domain owners to specify that web crawling
only be used for search engines, or only for non-commercial AI, or only for AI that attributes outputs
to their source data. New commands could also set extended restriction periods given dynamic
sites may want to block crawlers for extended periods of time, e.g. for journalists to protect their
data freshness. Ultimately, a new protocol should lead to website owners having greater capacity
to self-sort consensual from non-consensual uses, implementing machine-readable instructions that
approximate the natural language instructions in their Terms of Service.

Rising expressions of non-consent will affect non-profits, archives, and academic researchers.
A new wave of robots.txt and Terms of Service pages have not, or cannot, distinguish the various uses
of their data. For instance, having to individually prohibit a plethora of AI crawlers has motivated
many domains to simply blanket prohibit any crawling with the wildcard “*” marker. Or domains
have also limited crawlers from non-profit archives such as the Common Crawl Foundation or Internet
Archive, in order to prevent other organizations from downloaded their data for training. However,
these archives are also used for non-commercial uses of AI, as well as academic research, knowledge,
and accountability, well beyond the scope of AI. For instance, the Common Crawl is reported
to be cited in 10,000+ research articles from varying fields.5 This tension between data creators
and, predominantly, commercial AI developers has left academic and non-commercial interests as
secondary victims. As web consent continues to evolve, we believe it is essential that these often
essential facilities not be marginalized or severely hampered.

Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons

Economic fears of AI systems may change how internet data is created and protected. The
content on the internet was not created to be used for training AI models. Its use for this purpose is
already resulting in changing incentives around content creation, especially in cases where generative
AI competes with the original sources of content. As we show in Figure 4, large portions of today’s
internet are owned by commercial interests, with sites that are locked behind paywalls or financed by
advertisements. We expect small-scale content providers, who are less resourced to protect themselves
from undesired crawling, may opt out of the web entirely, or move to posting on walled, content
websites. If we don’t develop better mechanisms to give website owners control over how their data
is used, we should expect to see further decreases in the open web, with more websites locking their
data behind login or paywalls to prevent it being trained on.

Real-world AI uses may have implications for copyright and fair use. Analysis of copyright
infringement, including fair use, includes a four factor analysis. One analysis evaluates how the
use of a protected work (e.g., to train AI models) affects the potential market for the original work
(see 17 U.S.C §107). To investigate this question broadly, we document the major use settings of
primary training domains, and compare those to the real use cases found in WildChat (Section 3.4).
We find that while News domains dominate as a source of data, ChatGPT is not currently used
often for news—instead uses like creative compositions (such as role-play or fiction writing), sexual
role-play, brainstorming, or general information requests are most common. While there exist several
limitations to this analysis, outlined in Subsection 3.4, the mismatch in use cases between training
data and popular chatbots might suggest that AI chatbots are not directly competing with many of
their training sources. We caution against over-interpreting these results to suggest a stronger case for
fair use, as we believe future work is necessary to substantiate these findings and their relation to
nuanced legal discussions.

5 Related Work

Prior work has conducted large scale audits of the provenance, quality, biases, and characteristics
of AI training data, for pretraining text [32, 55, 34, 57], finetuning text [66], as well as multimodal
datasets [11, 13, 12, 109, 30], and challenges in data development [89]. Recent work have looked
at collecting non-copyrighted data [77], interpreting the legal implications of fair use for AI data
[44, 61], and forecasting future data constraints [120]. However, there is little work inspecting the
evolution of consent signals on AI data. Prior research have attempted to understand the link decay on
the web [25], the collection process for Common Crawl [5], or evolving behavior and implications of
web crawlers [60, 18, 58, 113, 19]. Initial news reports have begun to investigate the rate of blocking
AI web crawlers for general websites [86] and news publishers [127], laying the foundation for our
more rigorous analysis. The dearth of data documentation on AI datasets [39, 9, 101, 8] has been
highlighted as a challenge for understanding AI model behavior [67, 100, 74, 43, 81], reproducibility,
consent, and authenticity [68].

6 Conclusion

In this work, we presented the first, large-scale audit of the web sources underlying the massive
training corpora for modern, general-purpose AI. Our audit of 14, 000 web domains provides a view
the changing nature of crawlable content, consent norms, and points to daunting trends for the future
openness of the highest quality data used to train AI. The inconsistencies and omissions between
robots.txt and terms of service pages suggest a data ecosystem ill-equipped to signal or enforce
preferences. Lastly, we uncover distributional mismatches in the documented real uses of AI systems
and their underlying data. We release all our collected annotations and analysis, with the hope that
future work will further investigate the provenance, consent, and composition of the fundamental
ingredients to AI systems.6

Impact & Ethics Statement

Consent to copy, use and train on data is a complex issue. First, the robots.txt and Terms of Service
that communicate these intentions are owned by the web administrators, which are often imperfect

12

Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons

proxies for the actual copyright holders. For instance, social media websites or forums often host
content that was originally created or belongs to others. This is pervasive across the web. And there
are insufficient tools to attribute all content to their copyright holders, or disentangle consenting from
non-consenting use content—indeed that is partly demonstrated by this work. As such, it is important
to recognize that robots.txt and Terms of Service have become the status quo out of practicality,
though they suffer from limitations in ownership, and effective communication of intentions.

Additionally, while many data preference signals exist, which ones should be enforceable and how
they should be enforced both remain open questions, legally and ethically. Data crawling restrictions
can be motivated by intentions to protect copyright holders, privacy, or a desire to monetize the data
themselves. Some of these motivations may not override the competing right for humans to collect
public web material, for study, or non-commercial purposes. And, some have argued that humans, and
by extension machines, have the “right to read and learn” from open web data [48]. The laws, ethics,
and best practices that emerge around these conflicting goals will impact the future efficacy of AI
technologies, the types of organizations that are able to acquire sufficient data to compete in frontier
model development, as well as the economy of creators from which these datasets are sourced. In this
work, we do not prescribe legal or ethical answers, but describe the precise and evolving nature of
preference signals on the web. While we advocate for more protocols and mechanisms that enable
more effective communication of these intentions, we leave the adherence to these intentions as a
broader question for readers, developers, and legislators.

A Human Annotation Methodology Details

A.1 Details on Crowdworkers

Many of the annotations we rely on were provided by a group of crowdworkers. We engaged in an
extensive and iterative training process to ensure that each worker was comfortable with the task
and to guarantee consistency across them. We employed a total of 14 crowd source workers from
six countries: Pakistan (8), Bangladesh (2), Vietnam (1), Philippines (1), USA (1), and Germany
(1). We paid a total of $6,972 to annotate 14,228 rows of data, with a mean of $498 per worker, and
approximately $25-$30 per hour. Our data annotation process involved daily check-ins, review of
every 100-200 annotations, and feedback to ensure quality and consistency.

A.2 Human Annotation Guidelines

This section lays out the annotation guidelines used for our pretraining data collection, both for
annotations carried out by authors (in Appendix A.2.1) and for those carried out by crowdworkers (in
Appendix A.2.2).

A.2.1 Web Source Annotations (Authors)

Some websites, that were crawled in earlier years, have since been shutdown and no longer work. We
record this and exclude them from our analysis.

Instructions for Website Issue

Some websites have been sold or shut down since the scrape. In these cases, check the box
for website issues and don’t continue.

For User Content, we aimed to differentiate websites with significant portions of unmoderated user
content from those that are primarily comprised of content curated by the website administrators.
Over the course of annotating we found that the “Yes (strong moderation)” annotation label was often
used for news and encyclopedic sources which did accept some (usually moderated) user content,
but were most similar to websites without any user content (“No” label). In contrast, the “Yes (weak
moderation)” websites tended to include websites with significant degrees of raw user-generated
content, such as from social media websites, forums, or review sites. As such, in the paper we group
“No” and “Yes (strong moderation)” as not accepting significant user content, whereas “Yes (weak
moderation)” does.

Instructions for User Content

Is there a non-negligible amount of content on the website that comes from third-party users,
instead of the website host? Options:

Yes (strong moderation) – there is content from third-parties, but it is strongly moder-
ated/curated, either by the host, or by a review system. E.g. Wikipedia, academic journal
websites, or NYTimes, since it has a comments section, but it is carefully moderated.
Yes (weak moderation) – there is content from third-parties, that is only weakly mod-
erated. E.g. reddit, stackoverflow, youtube, ecommerce comment/review websites, or
very low-quality news sites that have unrefined op-eds and comments sections that
appear completely unmoderated.
No – all (or the vast majority) of website content is provided or well curated by the host.
E.g. company websites, patent records, government databases.

26

Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons

Instructions for “Website Description”

Write a short phrase that describes the purpose and domain of the website. The goal is to
help us cluster and categorize websites by their content domain (the type(s) of content/topics
they contain e.g. legal, biomedical, books) as well as the type/purpose of service the website
is providing (e.g. news, social media, exams, ecommerce, etc). While there is some overlap,
the first helps to distinguish where the training data might be useful, whereas the second
determines the purpose of the website, for copyright infringement questions.
Make sure the short phrase captures all major elements of a website’s purpose and content,
as there can be multiple, and is as precise as possible. Here are some examples:

• “Lifestyle blog about travel”
• “E-commerce for appliances and product reviews”
• “Video game news, forums, art, and retail”
• “Government database of parliamentary recordings and legislative documents”
• “Informal blog site for baking recipes”

The content domain and type of service categories should be easily inferred from the website
description.

The purpose of the Type of Service annotations is to understand the function of websites, and how
they might be related to the function of real user conversations with general-purpose models trained
on this web data. This is distinct from the text pretraining domain analysis conducted in prior work
[67], as the annotations are not about the relevant source or topic (e.g. legal, biomedical, social,
etc), but the functional purpose of the website for users. The taxonomy was developed after authors
reviewed hundreds of websites themselves, compared categories, and clustered common functions.

Instructions for “Type of Service”

What is the purpose or service of the website? This is relevant to US copyright infringement
analysis into the “effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the work”. i.e. will
copying this data jeopardize the website’s business.
We have listed out some common types of service below. Using the “website description”
you wrote, pick the best fitting type of service, or if none of these fit exactly, write your
own (Other) e.g. “Video Game Blogging”. We will later create more clusters based off these
suggestions. Here are the starter options:

• Ecommerce (e.g. Amazon, gaming, etc)
• Periodicals (News, magazine) (e.g. NYTimes, LATimes, Forbes, etc)
• Social Media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc)
• Encyclopedia/Database (e.g. Wikipedia, IMDB, etc)
• Academic (e.g. pubmed, nature, journals.plos.org, etc)
• Government (e.g. sec.gov, justia.com, parliament.uk, etc)
• Company/Organization/Personal website (e.g., www.ge.com)
• Blog websites (e.g., www.medium.com)
• Other: In a second stage, we will expand the list above

The purpose of annotating for Sensitive Content is to understand the distribution of content that
practitioners may wish to exclude from their corpus for reasons of toxicity, bias, nudity, hate speech,
or other offensive topics.

27

Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons

Instructions for “Illegal/Sensitive/NSFW Content”

Does the website contain a non-negligible amount of pornography, drug content, violence,
promotion of illegal activities, or hate speech. This should only be yes, if it’s more than a
minimal amount, for example while there are some sensitive things in Wikipedia, the answer
is no; whereas the answer is yes for Reddit.
Options:

• Pornography: y/n
• Drug content : y/n
• Violence: y/n
• Promotion of illegal activities: y/n
• Hate speech: y/n

A.2.2 Pretraining Datasets (Crowdworker)

General instructions

Please read the below instructions carefully, as accuracy is crucial for our analysis, and the
choices are sometimes nuanced. Turn off your ad blockers or browser extensions for this task.
Inspect each website thoroughly, navigating through many pages. This is essential for finding
ads, paywalls, videos, and audio content that may not be on the main page of the website.

Instructions for Website Issue

Some websites have been sold or shut down since the scrape. In these cases, check the box
for website issues and don’t continue.

Instructions to Annotate “Terms of Service Link(s)”

For each website domain, we want to find all links that are related to the domain’s terms,
including around general use, data, content, privacy, etc.. This will allow us to later identify
all legal terms associated with using the website, its content or data. It is critically important
that main terms pages are not missed, so we will randomly review some to make sure we are
getting a comprehensive list. The most important policies for our work are copyright-related
policies.
Here are 3 examples of the terms found for a website:

imdb.com Links:

• https://www.imdb.com/conditions
• https://www.imdb.com/licensing/subservicetc/
• https://www.imdb.com/privacy

plos.org Links:

• https://plos.org/terms-of-service/
• https://plos.org/text-and-data-mining/
• https://plos.org/terms-of-use/
• https://plos.org/privacy-policy/

goodreads.com Links:

• https://www.goodreads.com/about/terms

28

Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons

• https://www.goodreads.com/about/privacy
• https://www.goodreads.com/api/terms

Suggested procedure to find the links:

1. Many websites have links to their terms, privacy, or content policies at the bottom

of their main page. Scroll to the very bottom and see if any exist.

2. Sometimes not all relevant terms will appear there. We recommend you also search

for:
(a) “<website name> terms of use”
(b) “<website name> copyright policy”
(c) “<website name> content policy”
(d) “<website name> privacy policy”
(e) “<website name> developer policy”
(f) “<website name> data mining”

3. ONLY include pages you find that appear to be relevant to the legal conditions/terms
of using the website or data in some capacity. Very rarely, websites may have
hundreds of these pages. In those cases, feel free to just include the top few main
ones.

Instructions to Annotate “Paywall”

Does the website paywall any of its content? We hope to see what websites require some
sort of paid subscription or sign up (even if it offers free starter trials) in order to view their
content.
Output options:

• No – we did not find any paywall for any of the content. Examples: Wikipedia,

Reddit, Youtube.

• Some – a fair amount of content can be viewed without any issue (e.g. multiple
news articles), but after some reading/searching there appears to be a paywall on
the rest of the content. Examples: https://www.popularmechanics.com/.

• All – every main page of content is paywalled. This means that no single webpage
or article of content can be fully read without subscribing in some way. Examples:
NYTimes, Wall Street Journal.

Suggested procedure to determine if there is a paywall:

1. Make sure you are not logged into any accounts on your browser, especially ones

applicable to the website.

2. Explore the website content and see if a paywall request appears.
3. Double check by searching: “does <website name> have a paywall?”

Instructions to Annotate “Content Modalities”

What modalities of content appear on the website? A modality is the actual content of the
website, for which we have four options: text, images, videos, audio. These modalities can
appear at different levels, depending on the website. Do not count the content in automatic
embedded advertisements towards this.

• For text, there must be at least one paragraph or multiple sentences/captions on the

website.

• For images, there must be at least one or more distinct images embedded on the

page. Visual styling that is part of the website design does not count.

• For videos, there must be at least one embedded video – often they are not on the

main page, so you may need to look.

Output options:

• Text
• Images
• Videos
• Audio

Levels of modality appearing on the website:

• No – Content of this type is not on the website.
• Yes – There is content of this type, even if it’s not common, like images on Wikipedia.
Do not count visual styling/illustrations that are just part of the natural website
design – the presence of image(s) should be notable. Do not count the content in
ads.
Suggested procedure:

1. Try to find representative webpages on the website; if there is a search bar try to

search for some generic terms

2. Explore enough pages to be able to make a confident assessment of how much of

each modality is present.

Instructions to Annotate “Advertisements”

Do third-party advertisements appear on the website? Many websites host advertisements
to make money. They may appear on the top, bottom, or side bars of just some pages, so
look thoroughly. Self promotion does not count. These may not be on the main website page.
Remember to turn off your ad blockers / extensions.
Output options:

• No – No automatic advertisements are integrated into the pages.
• Yes – Some automatic advertisements do appear on the pages.

Suggested procedure:

1. Search through the website and its content, looking for advertisements.

B Automatic Annotation Methodology Details

B.1 Robots.txt Taxonomy

Using the Wayback Machine, we snapshotted websites’ robots.txt and terms of service at monthly
intervals from January 2016 to April 2024. For each web domain, we identified scraping constraints
for the wildcard ("*") as well as the user agents of the the six organizations commonly known to train
AI models (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Common Crawl). See Table 5 for details on
each of these organizations.

We then categorized the robots.txt restrictions for every web domain across an ascending spectrum of
restrictions. These were:

1. No robots.txt present.
2. No restrictions or sitemap: a simple directive allowing unrestricted access to crawlers, e.g.

observed, as well as the proportion of times a robots.txt restricts it either fully, partially, or not at all.
Lastly, the *ALL AGENTS* row refers to the number of total observations, as well as the tally of
instances where a robots.txt fully restricts every agent, partially restricts every agent, or restricts no

Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons

B.3 Terms of Service Taxonomy

After a close reading of hundreds of ToS pages, the paper authors noted three distinct indicators for
metered data usage: competing service clauses, license type, and in some cases, explicit crawling and
AI policies. To identify clauses relating to these topics at scale, we utilized the GPT-4o model with
custom prompting, sending requests through the OpenAI API. This section will detail the taxonomies
we developed for categorizing the ToS pages, as well as the prompt engineering and annotation
methodology behind automating the process.

Our taxonomies were designed with the variant nature of legal documents in mind. While we initially
tried to categorize ToS pages as either, TRUE or FALSE, for containing a policy relating to the
taxonomy at hand, we quickly found examples that broke this mold. In order to account for nuanced
clauses, our final taxonomies consist of multiple categories in ascending order of restrictiveness. The
order and definitions were refined as we came across enough additional examples to demand their
own category. For our temporal analysis, this structure allows us to better express the tightening
restrictions on web data over time.

See the finalized taxonomies below:

Competing services taxonomy

1. Non-Compete

• Definition: the ToS includes a clause that specifically prohibits the use of its
content, data, or materials for competing services. This category relates to
commercialization or other commercial uses of the site’s content and does not
include clauses that solely restrict scraping, storing data, or distributing data.

2. No Re-Distribution

• Definition: the ToS prohibits the distribution or reselling of content. This
includes clauses restricting selling content or creating and distributing datasets.
Does not include general commercial usage restrictions unless they directly
pertain to redistribution.
3. Non-Compete/No Re-Distribution

• Definition: both of the above categories are present in the given ToS.

4. No restrictions

• Definition: the ToS does not include clauses that restrict competing services or

re-distribution.

License type taxonomy

1. Personal/Noncommercial/Research Only

• Definition: the ToS explicitly states that the content is available for personal,
noncommercial, or research purposes only. Commercial use of the content is
strictly prohibited.

2. Conditional Commercial Access

• Definition: the ToS specifies that only certain parts of the website are open-
access or commercially viable, while other parts are restricted. Commercial
use is allowed under specific conditions (for example: permission must be
granted for commercial purposes, Commercial use is allowed but third-party
reposting is prohibited, non-compete clauses restrict using the content in ways
that compete with the service provider).

3. Open or Unrestricted Commercial Use

34

Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons

• Definition: the ToS does not explicitly disallow commercial use, indicating
that the website content is open for use or considered public information. This
category includes terms that allow commercial use without specific restrictions
or conditions (for example: creative Commons licenses permit commercial
use).

Crawling and AI taxonomy

1. Prohibits crawling and AI unconditionally

• Definition: the ToS explicitly states that both crawling and the use of data for

AI or ML are prohibited without exception.

2. Prohibits crawling unconditionally, but no mention of AI

• Definition: the ToS explicitly states that crawling and associated activities
(such as to copy, use, or distribute and other automated means) are prohibited
with no exceptions or conditions. Does not mention any restrictions to AI or
ML uses.

3. Prohibits AI unconditionally, but not crawling

• Definition: the ToS explicitly prohibits AI or ML usage without exception but

doesn’t mention a policy on crawling.

4. Only prohibits crawling and AI under certain conditions, or to certain parts of

the website

• Definition: the ToS provides conditions under which crawling and the use of
data for AI or ML are restricted or permitted. This category includes clauses
containing “With the exception of material marked ’Open Access’...”.

5. No restrictions on crawling or AI

• Definition: the ToS does not contain any clauses or mentions regarding the
prohibition or restriction of crawling or the use of data for AI or ML. Both
activities are implicitly allowed.

B.4 Prompt engineering

For each indicator—competing services, license type, and crawling and AI policies—we developed a
unique prompt directing GPT-4o to produce a verdict and supply directly quoted evidence. Based on
our taxonomy, the verdict corresponds to the best fitting category and the evidence is each instance of
text contributing to said verdict for a given ToS.

Our prompts were refined through an iterative process, comparing each output with a “gold answer”
annotation set to uncover shortcomings and improve (see section Appendix B.5 for details on the
annotation process). For each version of our prompt, we analyzed false negatives (clauses that the
model failed to recognize) to widen our scope and improve the specificity of our prompt, and analyzed
false positives (clauses that the model recognized incorrectly) to narrow our scope. The prompts were
modified using this methodology until preforming with an average accuracy of 85% or higher against
our annotation set [table 7].

See the finalized prompts below:

Competing services prompt

Your task is to analyze the provided Terms of Service (ToS) document to determine if there
are specific restrictions related to competing services or the redistribution of content. You
will categorize each ToS based on the following taxonomy:

35

Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons

1. Non-Compete:

Definition: the ToS includes a clause that specifically prohibits using or sharing its
content or data to create competing services. This does not include clauses solely
restricting scraping, storing data, or non-commercial use.

2. No Re-Distribution:

Definition: the ToS prohibits the distribution or reselling of content. This does
not include general commercial usage restrictions unless they directly pertain to
redistribution.

3. Non-Compete and No Re-Distribution:

Definition: both of the above categories are present in the given ToS.

4. No restrictions:

Definition: the ToS does not include clauses that restrict competing services or
re-distribution.

Return ONLY a dictionary with your verdict (a category number from the taxonomy) and the
corresponding evidence. Evidence does not need to be continuous, you should include all
mentions of a non-compete or no-redistribution. Do NOT include any additional text in your
response do NOT wrap your response with “‘json“‘. Format the response exactly like these
examples:

- {"verdict":1, "evidence": "Exact text from ToS detailing
Non-Compete."}
- {"verdict": 2, "evidence": "Exact text from ToS detailing No Re-Distribution."}
- {"verdict": 3, "evidence": "Exact text from ToS detailing Non-Compete; Exact text from ToS detailing No Re-Distribution"}
- {"verdict": 4, "evidence": "N/A"}

This format will assist in a comprehensive review of the ToS and allow for accurate catego-
rization based on the specific language used in the document.

License type prompt

Your task is to analyze the provided Terms of Service (ToS) document to determine the
license type, categorizing it based on the following taxonomy. Use direct quotes from the ToS
as evidence to support your categorization. Focus on the explicit language used regarding
permissions and restrictions for personal, noncommercial, or commercial use.

1. Personal/Noncommercial/Research Only:

Definition: the ToS restricts use to personal, noncommercial, or research purposes
without any exceptions allowing commercial use.

2. Conditional Commercial Access:

Definition: the ToS contains restrictions on general use but specifies conditions under
which commercial use is permitted. This includes needing permissions, complying
with certain conditions, or paying fees for commercial use. Look for terms like
’requires written permission,’ ’subject to approval,’ or ’commercial use permitted
under conditions.’

3. Open or Unrestricted Commercial Use:

Definition: the ToS permits commercial use broadly, without requiring additional
permissions or adhering to specific conditions. This includes terms that explicitly
allow or imply commercial use is permitted across all contents.

Return ONLY a dictionary with your verdict (a category number from the taxonomy) and the
corresponding evidence. Evidence does not need to be continuous, you should include all
mentions of a license type. Do NOT include any additional text in your response do NOT
wrap your response with “‘json“‘. Format the response exactly like these examples:

36

Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons

- {"verdict": 1, "evidence": "Exact text from ToS detailing

Personal/Noncommercial/Research Only license."}

- {"verdict": 2, "evidence ":" Exact text from ToS detailing

Conditional Commercial Access license."}

- {"verdict": 3, "evidence ": "Exact text from ToS detailing
Open or Unrestricted Commercial Use license or ’N/A’ if there is no
explicit mention."}

This will assist in a comprehensive review of the ToS and allow for accurate categorization
based on the specific language used in the document. Ensure that your assessment is detailed
and directly references the ToS document.

Crawling and AI prompt

Your job is to analyze the Terms of Service (ToS) document that I will provide you to
determine the policy on web scraping and artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning
(ML). You will categorize each ToS document based on the following taxonomy:

1. Prohibits scraping and AI unconditionally:

Definition: the ToS explicitly states that both scraping and the use of data for AI or
ML are prohibited without exception.

2. Prohibits scraping unconditionally, but no mention of AI:

Definition: the ToS explicitly states that scraping and associated activities (such
as to copy, use, or distribute and other automated means) are prohibited with no
exceptions or conditions. Does not mention any restrictions to AI or ML uses.

3. Prohibits AI unconditionally, but not scraping:

Definition: the ToS explicitly prohibits AI or ML usage without exception but
doesn’t mention a policy on scraping.

4. Only restricts or permits scraping and AI under certain conditions, or to certain

parts of the website:
Definition: the ToS provides conditions under which scraping and the use of data
for AI or ML are restricted or permitted. This category includes clauses containing
“With the exception of material marked ’Open Access’...”.

5. No restrictions on scraping or AI:

Definition: the ToS does not contain any clauses or mentions regarding the prohibi-
tion or restriction of scraping or the use of data for AI or ML. Both activities are
implicitly allowed.

Return ONLY a dictionary with your verdict (a category number from the taxonomy) and
the corresponding evidence. Evidence does not need to be continuous, you should include
all mentions of a scraping, AI or ML policy. Do NOT include any additional text in your
response do NOT wrap your response with “‘json“‘. Format the response exactly like these
examples:
- {"verdict": 1, "evidence": "Exact text from
scraping AND AI
- {"verdict": 2, "evidence": "Exact text from
scraping prohibition."}
- {"verdict": 3, "evidence": "Exact text from
AI prohibition"}
- {"verdict": 4, "evidence": "Exact text from
conditions restricting scraping and or AI."}
- {"verdict": 5, "evidence": "N/A"}

and directly references the ToS document.

B.5 Annotating and scoring

To empirically measure the ability of GPT-4o to follow our prompts and taxonomies, we manually
audited a sample of 100 URLs for each indicator in question: competing services, license type, and
crawling and AI. The URLs were randomly sampled from the 10k Random Subset and each ToS link
was carefully reviewed for clauses relating to our taxonomies. We found that most of the relevant
clauses were located in the Terms of Service (rather than a Privacy Policy or Copyright Notices page),
and we saved all verdicts and corresponding evidence to our annotation dataset for comparison with
the results from GPT-4o. With this “gold answer” annotation set, we calculated the mico-average
precision/recall of each prompt to ensure all class labels from our taxonomy were weighted relative
to their size, and the results are reported in Table 7.

B.6 WildChat Annotation

In Figure 4, we distinguish a wide range of different types of service related user prompts that serve
various purposes:

• Creative Composition: These requests involve role-playing, fictional story writing, or
continuing existing narratives, allowing users to explore their imaginative capabilities.
• Academic Composition: These focus on non-fiction essay writing, continuation, or editing,

aiding in scholarly and professional writing.

• Coding composition: These requests ask for assistance fixing, debugging, or general coding

help, supporting developers.

• Brainstorming, planning, or ideation: These requests ask the system to help brainstorm,

generate ideas, or plan out a project.

• Explanation & Reasoning: These prompts ask the system to explain or reason through a

question, help with puzzles, math problems or other problem-solving tasks.

• Self-help: These requests seek advice or support for personal issues, providing a platform

for guidance.

• Sexual content: These requests are related to sexually explicit content requests—such as

sexual role-play or fiction.

C Forecasting Method

We chose the SARIMA parameters through an automated model selection process using the
auto.arima function of the pmdarima package [110], and fit the models with the statsmodels
implementation of SARIMA [106]. The automated selection process chooses lag and differencing

orders, along with other parameters, to optimize the Akaike information criterion. We show the
selected parameters and their interpretations in Table 8.

Table 8: SARIMA parameter interpretation

Parameter
Non-seasonal order

Value
(2, 1, 2)

Seasonal order

(1, 1, 1, 6)

Description
- AutoRegressive (AR) order: 2
- Integrated (I) order: 1
- Moving Average (MA) order: 2
- Seasonal AutoRegressive (SAR) order: 1
- Seasonal Integrated (SI) order: 1
- Seasonal Moving Average (SMA) order: 1
- Seasonal periodicity: 6

The non-seasonal order (2, 1, 2) indicates that the current value being predicted is dependent on the
past 2 observations, the time series is differenced once to achieve stationarity, and the prediction is
influenced by the past 2 forecast errors. Similarly, the seasonal order (1, 1, 1, 6) indicates that the
current value is affected by the previous seasonal value, the seasonal component is differenced once
to remove seasonal non-stationarity, the prediction is impacted by the past seasonal forecast error,
and the data exhibits a recurring pattern every 6 periods.

D Extended Related Work

Data Documentation Previous work has highlighted the importance of data documentation in
machine learning [89, 100, 74, 43, 81]. These works particularly stress the challenges posed by
poor documentation to reproducibility, sound scientific practice, and understanding of model behav-
ior [101, 8, 67]. Recent research has also explored the significance of documenting AI ecosystems [15]

40

Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons

and the supply chain from data to models [23]. Previous studies have strongly advocated for and
provided frameworks for documentation and audits to enhance transparency and accountability in
AI systems [75, 50, 99]. Similar to Longpre et al. [66] which leverages the collective knowledge
of legal and machine learning experts, earlier research has emphasized the importance of interdis-
ciplinary collaborations [47]. ‘Datasheets for Datasets’ [39] and ‘Data Statements’ [9] both offer
structured frameworks for revealing essential metadata, such as the motivation behind and intended
use of datasets. Pushkarna et al. [96] expanded on datasheets with ‘Data Cards’ that include sources,
collection methods, ethics, and adoption information. Additionally, Mitchell et al. [78] introduced
model cards to benchmark model performance across demographic groups and disclose evaluation
procedures. Crisan et al. [29] proposed interactive model cards as an alternative mode of documenta-
tion and metadata sharing. Complementary to transparency regarding the dataset creation process,
Corry et al. [28] provides a framework to guide users on how to navigate datasets as they approach
the end of their life cycle. Longpre et al. [68] highlighted the importance of building standards across
data documentation, aspects of which we draw on here.

Data Audits Several works stressed the importance of auditing datasets used to train models [22, 13,
11]. Building these audits into the workflow on AI is critical to building accountability [56, 51]. While
previous works audited a variety of datasets and modalities, our work presents the largest and most
comprehensive analysis of data used in training foundation models. This is becoming more pressing
with the increasing richness of data sources, including those compiled by academics [124, 102, 80],
synthetically generated by models [114, 122], or aggregated by platforms like Hugging Face [63].
The trend of combining and re-packaging numerous datasets and web sources has become prevalent
among practitioners [38, 91, 123, 65]. Significant work has gone into analyzing these underlying
text datasets (in particular CommonCrawl) [71, 40, 69, 22]. Several notable works have conducted
large-scale analyses into data, particularly pretraining text corpora [38, 32, 55, 59, 104, 105, 72].
Other works have investigated the geo-diversity of vision-based datasets [109, 30, 70]. In terms of
finding and visualizing datasets, a few recent tools have been proposed [36, 121].

Web Audits Previous work has attempted to understand the changing landscape of the web through
various web audits and to understand the evolving behavior and implications of web crawlers. A
study [25] investigated how often webpages that once existed become inaccessible by looking at a
sample of webpages from Common Crawl from 2013 to 2023 and found that 38% of webpages that
existed in 2013 are no longer accessible a decade later. Previous work has studied the identification
and characterization of traffic generated by web crawlers [60, 18, 58] including temporal analysis of
web crawlers activity [113, 19]. In [86], an analysis of the top 1000 websites in the world focused
on identifying which sites are blocking popular AI web crawlers such as OpenAI’s GPTBot or the
Google-Extended bot and found almost 35% of these websites blocked GPTBot vs 12.5% only for
the Google-Extended bot. A similar study [127] found that more than 53% of 1,164 surveyed news
publishers blocked GPTBot vs 41.3% for the Google-Extended bot.

Challenges in data transparency and its harms Despite efforts to document datasets [93, 10],
there is a growing crisis in data transparency. The sheer scale of modern data collection and heightened
scrutiny over copyright issues [103] have disincentivized thorough attribution and documentation
of data lineage. This lack of transparency has led to a decline in understanding training data, as
evidenced by the reduced number of datasheets [39] and the non-disclosure of training sources
by prominent models [84, 2, 117]. This gap in documentation can result in data leakages between
training and test sets [33, 20], exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) [17], and the
perpetuation of biases and unintended behaviors [126, 129, 95], the large portions of hateful material
in datasets [12, 13], all of which can cause significant harm [125]. Transparency becomes even more
critical when assessing the supply chain risks of AI [45] and the ease of data poisoning in web-scale
data [21].

Data governance Given the importance of data documentation and auditing, and the increasing
difficulty of managing and working with ever increasing datasets, various efforts have been pushed at
the data governance front, including the BigScience project [49] and the Public Data Trust [24].
