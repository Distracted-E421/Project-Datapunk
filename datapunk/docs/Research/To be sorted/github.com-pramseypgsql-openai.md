OpenAI API Client for PostgreSQL

Using the http extension for web access, this extension provides utility functions to make it
easier to work against the OpenAI API. The API is avilable from OpenAI of course, but also
from other tools like the Ollama runner for local AI models.

Uses

The most obvious uses for AI in the database are:

Classification and text analysis. Tie an AI trigger to freeform text fields in your
database, so that new data (like reviews and comments) are automatically analyzed
and categorized (sentiment analysis for example).
Similarity searching. In conjunction with the pgvector extension, find the "N most
similar" items in a corpus. Recommendation engines, for example, can find similar
items in a corpus to the one a user is currently looking at.
Retrieval-augmented generation. A combination of basic chatbot technology and
similarity searching to improve the results of a natural language AI query by feeding the
model with relevant contextual documents before posing a query.

Setup

Using OpenAI

Set up an OpenAI API key
Create a working database
Enable the HTTP extension

CREATE EXTENSION http;

2/6

Set the up the session keys

SET openai.api_key = 'your_api_key_here'; 
SET openai.api_uri = 'https://api.openai.com/v1/'; 
SET openai.prompt_model = 'gpt-4o-mini'; 
SET openai.embedding_model = 'text-embedding-3-small';

(Optionally) make the keys persistent

ALTER DATABASE your_db SET openai.api_key = 'your_api_key_here'; 
ALTER DATABASE your_db SET openai.api_uri = 'https://api.openai.com/v1/'; 
ALTER DATABASE your_db SET openai.prompt_model = 'gpt-4o-mini';
ALTER DATABASE your_db SET openai.embedding_model = 'text-embedding-3-small';

Using Ollama

If you have a workstation with a reasonable amount of memory (16GB or more) you can
consider running a mid-sized model locally instead of using OpenAI services.

Download Ollama for your workstation

Verify you can run ollama

then ollama pull llama3.1:latest
and ollama pull mxbai-embed-large

Set the up the session keys

SET openai.api_uri = 'http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1/'; 
SET openai.api_key = 'none'; 
SET openai.prompt_model = 'llama3.1:latest'; 
SET openai.embedding_model = 'mxbai-embed-large';

(Optionally) make the keys persistent

ALTER DATABASE your_db SET openai.api_uri = 'http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1/'; 
ALTER DATABASE your_db SET openai.api_key = 'none'; 
ALTER DATABASE your_db SET openai.prompt_model = 'llama3.1:latest'; 
ALTER DATABASE your_db SET openai.embedding_model = 'mxbai-embed-large';

Usage

Functions

openai.models() returns setof record. Returns a listing of the AI models available
via the API.
openai.prompt(context text, query text, [model text]) returns text. Set up
context and then pass in a starting prompt for the model.
openai.vector(query text, [model text]) returns text. For use with embedding
models (Ollama, OpenAI) only, returns a JSON-formatted float array suitable for direct
input into pgvector. Using non-embedding models to generate embeddings will result in
extremely poor search results.

Basic Examples

Read back the settings your database is using.

SHOW openai.api_uri;

      openai.api_uri        
---------------------------- 
http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1/ 

List all the models running behind the API you are connecting to. If it is a local API like
Ollama, probably a short list. If it is a hosted API like OpenAI, probably a long one.

SELECT openai.models();

SELECT * FROM openai.models(); 

           id            | object |       created       | owned_by  
--------------------------+--------+---------------------+---------- 
mxbai-embed-large:latest | model  | 2024-11-04 20:48:39 | library 
llama3.1:latest          | model  | 2024-07-25 22:45:02 | library 

Query the model about factual matters. For small models or obscure facts, this may likely
return hallucinated results.

SELECT openai.prompt( 

'You are a very smart physics teacher.', 
'What is the speed of light?' 
);

A classic question! The speed of light, in a vacuum (a completely  
empty space with no air or matter), is approximately...  
(dramatic pause) ...299,792,458 meters per second!                                + 

Use the model to summarize a free-form text input. In the extreme, a sentiment analysis
prompt can instruct the model to use a fixed set of output tokens, for nice programmatic
filtering of free-form inputs.

SELECT openai.prompt( 

 'You are an advanced sentiment analysis model. Read the given  
  feedback text carefully and classify it as one of the  
  following sentiments only: "positive", "neutral", or  
  "negative". Respond with exactly one of these words  
  and no others, using lowercase and no punctuation', 
 'I enjoyed the setting and the service and the bisque was  
  great.' );

 prompt   
---------- 
positive 

Calculate the embedding vector for a given piece of input. Useful for "find the most similar"
queries or as an input to retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems.

SELECT openai.vector('A lovely orange pumpkin pie recipe.');

Debugging

To see what's going on inside the functions, set the debug level:

SET client_min_messages = debug;

To work around HTTP timeouts, increase the timeout interval:

SELECT http_set_curlopt('CURLOPT_TIMEOUT', '10');
