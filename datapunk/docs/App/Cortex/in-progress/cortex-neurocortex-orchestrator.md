### 1.2 Component Architecture

#### Core Processing Engine

The Core Processing Engine serves as the central nervous system of the NeuroCortex, orchestrating all AI operations through three primary components: Task Manager, Resource Allocator, and Pipeline Coordinator. The engine is designed to handle complex AI workloads while maintaining optimal resource utilization and processing efficiency.

```yaml
processing_engine:
  components:
    task_manager:
      priority_levels: [critical, high, medium, low]
      queue_depth: 1000
      scheduling_algorithm: "weighted_fair"
    
    resource_allocator:
      strategy: "dynamic"
      monitoring_interval: "1s"
      reallocation_threshold: 0.8
    
    pipeline_coordinator:
      max_concurrent_pipelines: 100
      buffer_size: 1000
      processing_timeout: "30s"
```

The Task Manager implements priority-based scheduling with four distinct levels, managing request queues and workload distribution. The Resource Allocator employs dynamic allocation strategies, monitoring system resources every second and reallocating when usage reaches 80% threshold. The Pipeline Coordinator handles both standard and real-time processing pipelines, maintaining up to 100 concurrent pipelines with built-in backpressure management.

Integration with Haystack and LangChain enables sophisticated document processing and LLM operations, while coordination with the Lake service facilitates efficient vector storage operations. The engine's modular design allows for future expansion and optimization of AI processing capabilities.

> Note: This section requires further elaboration on specific implementation details, integration patterns, and optimization strategies. Additional documentation will be needed for deployment configurations and scaling considerations.

#### Task Distribution System

The Task Distribution System (TDS) forms the backbone of NeuroCortex's workload management, handling everything from initial request intake to final task execution. This system ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining service quality and reliability.

##### Current Functionality

1. **Request Router**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Task classification
   - Priority assignment
   - Resource requirement estimation

```python
# Example Request Router Configuration
class RequestRouter:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.validators = {
            'nlp': NLPValidator(),
            'ml': MLValidator(),
            'vector': VectorValidator()
        }
        self.classifiers = TaskClassifierEngine()
        self.priority_engine = PriorityAssignment()
        self.resource_estimator = ResourceEstimator()

    async def route_request(self, request: AIRequest) -> RoutedTask:
        # Validate input based on task type
        validated_input = self.validators[request.type].validate(request.payload)
        
        # Classify task and assign priority
        task_class = self.classifiers.classify(validated_input)
        priority = self.priority_engine.assign_priority(task_class, request.metadata)
        
        # Estimate resource requirements
        resources = self.resource_estimator.estimate(task_class, validated_input)
        
        return RoutedTask(
            validated_input=validated_input,
            classification=task_class,
            priority=priority,
            resource_requirements=resources
        )
```

2. **Workload Balancer**

The Workload Balancer implements dynamic load distribution across available processing nodes:

```yaml
workload_balancer:
  strategies:
    primary: round_robin
    fallback: least_connections
  health_checks:
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 3s
    failure_threshold: 3
  queue_management:
    max_queue_size: 1000
    overflow_strategy: backpressure
```

Key Components:

- Dynamic load distribution using adaptive algorithms
- Real-time health monitoring of processing nodes
- Automated failover handling
- Queue optimization with backpressure mechanisms

3. **Task Scheduler**

```yaml
scheduler:
  algorithms:
    - priority_based
    - fair_share
    - resource_aware
  constraints:
    max_retry_count: 3
    timeout: "5m"
    backoff_multiplier: 1.5
```

The scheduler implements a multi-strategy approach:

```mermaid

flowchart TD
    A[Incoming Task] --> B{Priority Check}
    B -->|Critical| C[Priority Queue]
    B -->|Normal| D[Fair Share Queue]
    C --> E[Resource Allocation]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Execution]
    F -->|Success| G[Complete]
    F -->|Failure| H{Retry?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Backoff]
    I --> B
    H -->|No| J[Error Handler]
```

    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.ml_predictor = MLPredictor()  # For predicting task requirements
        self.cost_optimizer = CostOptimizer()  # For optimizing resource costs
        self.context_manager = ContextManager()  # For maintaining task context

    async def schedule(self, task: Task) -> ScheduledTask:
        # Predict resource requirements
        predicted_resources = await self.ml_predictor.predict(task)
        
        # Optimize for cost and performance
        optimal_slot = await self.cost_optimizer.find_optimal_slot(
            task, predicted_resources
        )
        
        # Consider task context and dependencies
        context = await self.context_manager.get_context(task)
        
        return self.create_scheduled_task(task, optimal_slot, context)
```

##### Current Functionality for RMF

```python
class ResourcePool:
    """
    Dynamic resource pool management for NeuroCortex
    Integrates with existing CacheManager and Pipeline components
    """
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.memory_pool = MemoryManager(config["memory_config"])
        self.cpu_pool = CPUManager(config["compute_resources"])
        self.storage_pool = StorageManager(config["storage_config"])
        self.network_pool = NetworkManager(config["network_config"])
        
    async def allocate_resources(self, task_requirements: ResourceRequirements) -> ResourceAllocation:
        """Allocate resources based on task requirements and current availability"""
        allocation = ResourceAllocation()
        
        # Check resource availability
        if not self._check_availability(task_requirements):
            raise ResourceExhaustedException("Insufficient resources")
            
        # Allocate resources with priority consideration
        allocation.memory = await self.memory_pool.allocate(task_requirements.memory)
        allocation.cpu = await self.cpu_pool.allocate(task_requirements.cpu)
        allocation.storage = await self.storage_pool.allocate(task_requirements.storage)
        
        return allocation
```

2. **Cache Management for RMF**

```python
class DistributedCacheCoordinator:
    """
    Coordinates cache operations across multiple NeuroCortex instances
    """
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.local_cache = CacheManager(config)
        self.redis_coordinator = RedisCoordinator(config["redis"])
        
    async def coordinate_invalidation(self, cache_key: str):
        """Coordinate cache invalidation across instances"""
        await self.redis_coordinator.publish("cache_invalidate", {
            "key": cache_key,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "source_instance": self.instance_id
        })
```
