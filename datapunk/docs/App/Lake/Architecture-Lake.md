# Datapunk Lake Architecture

## Overview

The datapunk-lake container serves as the primary data storage and processing layer, handling bulk data imports and maintaining the core database infrastructure. It's designed to be independent and compatible with different backend services while maintaining strict data sovereignty.

## Core Components

### PostgreSQL Extensions

Core Extensions (Compatible with PostgreSQL 16.x):

- PostGIS (3.4+): Spatial data handling
- pgvector (0.5.1+): Vector embeddings storage
- TimescaleDB (2.13+): Time-series data optimization
- pg_cron (1.6+): Automated maintenance tasks
- pg_stat_statements: Query performance monitoring
- pg_partman (5.0+): Automated partition management
- hstore: Flexible metadata storage
- pg_trgm: Fuzzy text search capabilities

Performance & Caching:

- pg_prewarm: Cache warming after restarts
- pg_memcache: Memcached integration for query caching
- pgbouncer: Connection pooling (runs separately)
- pg_stat_kcache: System resource usage monitoring
- pg_buffercache: Shared buffer analysis

Analytics & Monitoring:

- pganalyze_collector: Performance analytics
- pg_prometheus: Prometheus metrics export
- pg_qualstats: Index usage statistics
- pg_stat_monitor: Enhanced query monitoring

Search & Text Processing:

- pg_similarity: Advanced text similarity matching

Note: All listed extensions are compatible with PostgreSQL 16.x, which is recommended for Datapunk. Some extensions (like pgbouncer) run as separate services rather than as internal extensions.

Important Configuration Notes:

- Enable pg_stat_statements by default
- Configure pgbouncer for connection pooling
- Set up pg_cron for automated maintenance
- Enable pg_stat_monitor for detailed query analysis

### Schema Organization

The schema organization within the Datapunk Lake is crucial for maintaining data integrity, optimizing performance, and ensuring efficient data retrieval. Below is an expanded description of each schema, detailing its purpose, structure, and any relevant considerations.

- **user_data**: 
  - **Purpose**: This schema is designed to store individual user data, ensuring data isolation and privacy. Each user will have a dedicated schema to prevent data leakage and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
  - **Structure**: 
    - Tables for user profiles, preferences, and settings.
    - Data partitioning based on user IDs to enhance query performance.
    - Indexing strategies to optimize search and retrieval operations.
  - **Considerations**: Implement row-level security policies to restrict access based on user identity.

- **imports**: 
  - **Purpose**: Serves as a staging area for bulk data processing, particularly for large data imports such as Google Takeout.
  - **Structure**: 
    - Temporary tables for raw data ingestion.
    - Metadata tables to track import status, timestamps, and error logs.
    - Validation and sanitization processes to ensure data quality before moving to permanent storage.
  - **Considerations**: Implement automated cleanup processes to remove old or failed import records.

- **analytics**: 
  - **Purpose**: This schema is dedicated to derived analytics and aggregations, providing insights from the raw data stored in other schemas.
  - **Structure**: 
    - Tables for aggregated metrics, trends, and statistical analyses.
    - Pre-computed views for frequently accessed reports.
    - Support for time-series data to facilitate historical analysis.
  - **Considerations**: Regularly update analytics tables to reflect changes in the underlying data, and consider using materialized views for performance optimization.

- **vectors**: 
  - **Purpose**: This schema is specifically for storing vector embeddings generated from various data sources, enabling efficient similarity searches and machine learning applications.
  - **Structure**: 
    - Tables for different types of embeddings (e.g., text, image, audio).
    - Indexing strategies such as HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) for fast nearest neighbor searches.
    - Metadata tables to track the origin and versioning of embeddings.
  - **Considerations**: Ensure that the embedding generation process is well-documented and version-controlled to maintain consistency across updates.

- **timeseries**: 
  - **Purpose**: Optimized for storing and querying time-series data, this schema supports applications that require historical data analysis and trend forecasting.
  - **Structure**: 
    - Tables designed for efficient time-series storage, utilizing PostgreSQL extensions like TimescaleDB.
    - Partitioning strategies based on time intervals (e.g., daily, monthly) to enhance query performance.
    - Support for continuous aggregates to provide real-time insights.
  - **Considerations**: Implement retention policies to manage the lifecycle of time-series data, archiving older data as necessary.

- **archive**: 
  - **Purpose**: This schema is intended for historical data storage, ensuring that older records are preserved for compliance and auditing purposes.
  - **Structure**: 
    - Tables for archived user data, import logs, and historical analytics.
    - Metadata to track the archiving process, including timestamps and reasons for archiving.
  - **Considerations**: Establish clear policies for data retention and access to archived records, ensuring that sensitive information is handled appropriately.
