Hi.
*** REVISED LINK TO SPREADSHEET BELOW ***

I have graded your Business Requirements document. Several of you did well, and I was pleased. A few of you need to add a lot more detail on your features and development needs.
I have revised the syllabus to have the next assignment - Task Estimation and Testing - due in two weeks - October 20, 11:59pm. It was originally going to be split into two parts, with one due next Sunday and the other due the Sunday after that, but I wanted to give you more time for the task estimation part. Please make good use of the extra time. Do not procrastinate. Instead, start immediately while the work you did on the requirements document is still fresh in mind.
This assignment combines two important deliverables:
Task estimation: a very detailed account of the tasks you will perform to deliver a product with the features you identified in the previous assignment.
Test plans: once your initial development on your project is complete, how will you test it to make sure it works?
These two tasks must be completed by filling in this spreadsheet:
https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/opj63v8g223j4h7fi9klz/task_estimation_and_testing_spreadsheet.xlsx?rlkey=c7le7t5jpwp12gtfbi5gyxsiy&st=h9cddo5k&dl=0

Just download the xlsx file and begin filling it in. Submit it to complete this assignment.
I have recorded a video to help you understand how to complete it:

Please watch it and let me know if you have questions.
This is due Sunday, October 20 by 11:59pm.

Some of you will have to work on your Business Requirements document more before trying to itemize tasks and write test plans. You need to have a very clear and focused accounting of the features you will deliver, with every detail envisioned from the user's or customer's perspective. What features will the user make use of, and how will you deliver these features to the user? If you aren't clear on those details at a very precise level - and some of you were but some of you weren't on the last assignment - you can't come up with a schedule of tasks you will complete nor how to test the features you deliver. You must be very clear in your understanding of what features you will deliver or you can't estimate tasks and create test plans. So make sure you spend the first part of this week working on refining your requirements document if I indicated you need to. Then watch the video I linked above and begin filling in the spreadsheet.
Again, this is due October 20 at 11:59pm.
As always, let me know when you have questions.

Hi, everybody.

Hopefully you've been spending some quality time working thoughtfully on your task estimation and test plans. Please make sure you complete these items on the Excel spreadsheet and submit the Excel spreadsheet to Blackboard. Please clearly identify the names of the team members on the first sheet of the Excel document. Note that you need to turn in only one Excel document per team.

Please watch the video I posted to ensure that you are doing it correctly. It will not be sufficient to have only one task listed per feature. You have to be very clear about how you will build each feature and how long each task will take. There is no way you can implement a feature by doing just one task. Instead, you have to be very detailed in describing exactly how you will deliver what you promise, and that means listing probably several tasks. 

Likewise, your test plans have to be detailed as well.

Perhaps one way to make sure you have the right amount of detail is to read your list of tasks and ask yourself whether you think the feature they support would actually be ready for the user to use if you performed all those tasks successfully. Similarly, a way to gauge whether you've sufficiently documented a test plan is to ask yourself if carrying out that test will help you assess conclusively whether the feature is working as it should.

Remember that you've had two weeks to do this task, so it should represent two weeks of your serious effort and demonstrate your detailed understanding of what you will be doing to implement your features during the next seven weeks. What you include in the spreadsheet is your plan for what you will do for the remainder of the course to deliver what you've promised. So doing a good job sets you up to succeed. Doing a poor or half-hearted job will make it very difficult for you to achieve your goals.

Please don't wait until the last couple of hours to complete this. You should have started it over a week ago, so you probably are pretty close to being done.

Let me know if you have any qeustions.

Thanks.
