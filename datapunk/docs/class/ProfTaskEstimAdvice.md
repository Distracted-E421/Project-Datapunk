Hi, everybody.



Hopefully you've been spending some quality time working thoughtfully on your task estimation and test plans. Please make sure you complete these items on the Excel spreadsheet and submit the Excel spreadsheet to Blackboard. Please clearly identify the names of the team members on the first sheet of the Excel document. Note that you need to turn in only one Excel document per team.



Please watch the video I posted to ensure that you are doing it correctly. It will not be sufficient to have only one task listed per feature. You have to be very clear about how you will build each feature and how long each task will take. There is no way you can implement a feature by doing just one task. Instead, you have to be very detailed in describing exactly how you will deliver what you promise, and that means listing probably several tasks. 



Likewise, your test plans have to be detailed as well.



Perhaps one way to make sure you have the right amount of detail is to read your list of tasks and ask yourself whether you think the feature they support would actually be ready for the user to use if you performed all those tasks successfully. Similarly, a way to gauge whether you've sufficiently documented a test plan is to ask yourself if carrying out that test will help you assess conclusively whether the feature is working as it should.



Remember that you've had two weeks to do this task, so it should represent two weeks of your serious effort and demonstrate your detailed understanding of what you will be doing to implement your features during the next seven weeks. What you include in the spreadsheet is your plan for what you will do for the remainder of the course to deliver what you've promised. So doing a good job sets you up to succeed. Doing a poor or half-hearted job will make it very difficult for you to achieve your goals.



Please don't wait until the last couple of hours to complete this. You should have started it over a week ago, so you probably are pretty close to being done.



Let me know if you have any qeustions.



Thanks.
