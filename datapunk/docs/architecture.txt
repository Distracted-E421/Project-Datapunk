  NueroCortex:
      [The concept of the NueroCortex is similar to the ai GAIA in the video game series Horizon. It will be the central ai unit, composed of haystack to manage low level data and tasks, and langchain to leverege large language models with the data, before a user even sees it. It will also be able to leverage any local models created by Nueromancer.]

  Nueromancer:
    [Using the Horizon games ai model(s) as a metaphore, Nueromancer is akin to Hephestus, producing local models trained on user data that the NueroCortex can leverage to act as sub models and specific task/purpose models.]
