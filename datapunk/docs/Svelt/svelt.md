### 1. **Core Technology Stack**

- **Frontend Framework**: **SvelteKit**

  - SvelteKit is a framework built on top of Svelte that handles routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and has built-in support for Vite for fast development and build processes. It is ideal for Datapunk’s needs, as it integrates smoothly with APIs and allows for easy state management.
- **State Management**: **Svelte Stores**

  - Svelte's `writable` and `readable` stores replace complex state management libraries like Redux. Stores handle shared and persistent state easily, making it well-suited for managing user settings, data filters, and visualization preferences.
- **Data Visualization**: **D3.js** and **Svelte-based Libraries**

  - For creating interactive charts and complex data visualizations, **D3.js** is recommended, and it’s highly compatible with Svelte. For map-based visualizations (e.g., geospatial data in Datapunk), **SvelteLeaflet** or **Leaflet directly** can be used, leveraging PostGIS data for map displays.
- **API and Data Handling**: **Fetch API** (native) or **Axios**

  - Since SvelteKit supports API calls with simple async fetch calls, this will allow for both frontend and server-side requests. For complex data handling or structured error handling, Axios can still be used as an alternative.
- **CSS and Styling**: **TailwindCSS**

  - TailwindCSS offers a utility-first approach to styling, helping to create a consistent design without needing extensive custom CSS. TailwindCSS integrates well with Svelte and works smoothly with dynamic UI elements for dashboards.

### 2. **Recommended Folder Structure for Datapunk’s Svelte Frontend**

To create a clean, maintainable structure, here’s a suggested layout:

```
/src
│
├── /lib                # Reusable components, stores, utilities
│   ├── /components     # All UI components (e.g., charts, widgets)
│   ├── /stores         # Centralized state management (Svelte stores)
│   ├── /utils          # Utility functions (data parsing, formatting)
│   └── /styles         # Global styles or custom Tailwind configurations
│
├── /routes             # SvelteKit page routes
│   ├── /dashboard      # Main dashboard with customizable widgets
│   ├── /settings       # User settings and preferences page
│   ├── /import         # Data import/upload page
│   └── /api            # SvelteKit API routes for server-side functions
│
└── /assets             # Static assets (e.g., images, icons)
```

### 3. **Component Design for Key Functionalities**

Each component will be self-contained with its logic, HTML, and CSS to promote reusability and maintainability. Here’s how you might break down the components and the role they play in Datapunk:

- **Data Visualization Components (`/lib/components/visualizations`)**

  - `Chart.svelte`: A general chart component that configures D3.js or similar chart libraries. Allows reusability for line, bar, and scatter plots.
  - `MapView.svelte`: Displays maps with SvelteLeaflet or Leaflet and connects to PostGIS for geospatial data.
  - `TrendWidget.svelte`: Configurable component for small insights or KPI displays, like tracking productivity over time.
- **Customizable Widgets (`/lib/components/widgets`)**

  - `WidgetContainer.svelte`: Container with drag-and-drop functionality, customizable size, and layout for each widget.
  - `WidgetSettings.svelte`: A modal or sidebar for each widget that allows customization (e.g., data source, time range, visualization type).
- **Dashboard and Navigation**

  - `Dashboard.svelte`: Main dashboard page where users can arrange their widgets.
  - `Navbar.svelte`: Top navigation bar for easy access to main pages and settings.
  - `Sidebar.svelte`: A sidebar for quickly accessing different sections of data or settings.

### 4. **State Management with Svelte Stores**

In Svelte, stores are efficient and straightforward, perfect for managing application-wide state. Here are the stores you might create for Datapunk:

- **User Settings Store (`/lib/stores/userSettings.js`)**: Holds user preferences, theme settings, and layout choices.
- **Data Store (`/lib/stores/data.js`)**: Manages parsed and cleaned data, including imported files and API responses, updated as the user imports or syncs new data.
- **Visualization Store (`/lib/stores/visualization.js`)**: Manages visualization-specific settings, such as data filters, selected timeframes, and widget configurations.

### 5. **Data Handling and API Structure**

For the data-centric Datapunk, API and data processing functions will play a significant role:

- **API Routes**: SvelteKit allows server-side API functions within the `/routes/api` directory, which is perfect for processing data. Examples include:
  - `GET /api/import-data`: Handles data import requests and integrates with the backend for data parsing.
  - `GET /api/visualizations`: Retrieves preprocessed or aggregated data from the backend for fast visualization loading.
- **Data Parsing Utilities (`/lib/utils/dataParsing.js`)**: This utility module will include functions for transforming JSON, CSV, or other imported data formats into Svelte-compatible structures. This ensures data is ready for visualizations right out of the box.

### 6. **Styling and UI Customization**

- **TailwindCSS** will simplify styling, making it easy to maintain consistent visual aesthetics.
- **Global Styles** (`/lib/styles/global.css`): Any custom global styles or theme settings should be defined here, such as custom colors, fonts, or spacing adjustments.
- **Component-Specific Styles**: Individual components, especially visualizations, will contain scoped styles that won’t interfere with the broader layout.

### 7. **Development and Testing Tools**

- **Tooling**: Since SvelteKit is Vite-powered, it provides fast reloads and modern bundling, ideal for a productive development environment.
- **Testing**: Use **Svelte Testing Library** for unit tests on components, along with **Cypress** for end-to-end testing, particularly for interactive dashboard functionality.

### Example Workflow for Key Features

1. **Data Import and Parsing**

   - User uploads data on `/import`, which triggers the `importData` function in the `Data Store`.
   - The data is processed via a utility function in `/lib/utils/dataParsing.js` and stored in the `Data Store`.
   - Data is then displayed as widgets or visualization components on the dashboard.
2. **Visualization and Interaction**

   - User selects a widget from the `WidgetContainer.svelte` on the dashboard.
   - The `WidgetSettings.svelte` component lets users adjust timeframes and other filters, saving preferences in the `Visualization Store`.
   - The `Chart.svelte` component receives updates from the `Visualization Store` and re-renders accordingly.
3. **Customizable Dashboard Experience**

   - Each widget’s position and size are managed in the `userSettings` store, enabling users to move widgets dynamically.
   - SvelteKit handles dynamic updates seamlessly, keeping the UI responsive and lightweight.
