# Datapunk Forge (NeuroMancer) Architecture

## Overview

The datapunk-forge container, also known as NeuroMancer, serves as the AI model factory of the system. Similar to Hephaestus in Horizon, it focuses on producing and managing local models trained on user-specific data. This component is responsible for model training, optimization, and lifecycle management.

## Core Components

- Deployment management
- A/B testing support
- Model serving

## Training Pipeline

### 1. Feature Engineering

- Feature extraction
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Dimensionality reduction
- Feature store integration (Feast)

### 2. Model Development

resources:
limits:
cpu: "4"
memory: "8G"
requests:
cpu: "2"

- Cache hit rates
- Error rates

## Docker Configuration

 @Codebase  Lets goahead and do a doc similar to what we have for data lake stream and cortex, but for the datapunk-forge (also called nueromancer)

I'll help create a detailed architecture document for datapunk-forge/NeuroMancer based on the provided codebase. From the references, I can see that NeuroMancer is analogous to Hephaestus in the Horizon series (reference from datapunk/docs/planning/thoughtsonai.md lines 237-238) and serves as the model training component of the system.

This architecture document incorporates references from multiple provided files while maintaining consistency with the overall system design and philosophy. It's structured to mirror the format of the datapunk-lake and datapunk-stream documents while focusing on the specific AI model training and management responsibilities of the forge component.
can you rewriteto make it easy to copy into a test file?

Here's the same content formatted as a markdown file that you can easily copy:
