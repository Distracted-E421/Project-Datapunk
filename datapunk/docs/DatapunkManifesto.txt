We live in a cyberpunk hellscape dystopia, and it's time we called it what it is.

To take a quick inventory of our world in October 2024: the Middle East is ablaze, and there seems to be no end in sight. Anti-Semitic sentiments, whether acknowledged or not, are becoming frighteningly normalized across much of the world. Feels just like the 1930s all over again. In the United States, a convicted felon and wannabe autocrat (yes, I mean Donald Trump) stands neck and neck in the polls with the only other serious candidate, his campaign funded by millions in donations from a foreign billionaire with shady interests and spouting BS conspiracies to incite violence (yes, I mean Elon Musk). Ukraine continues to be torn apart by war and Russian war crimes, while Western nations sit on their hands and do the bare fucking minimum, as right-wing politicians' hem and haw about "both sides", "not our problem", and other shit like that.

The internet, once a thriving, messy town square of people’s voices, is increasingly awash in AI-generated noise, half-baked misinformation, and cleverly-crafted propaganda. China has infected the world with the plague and trap that is TikTok, shortening our attention spans, and intentionally promoting unhealthy behaviors and child exploitation. Russia continues to interfere with international politics, especially right-wing autocratic movements (MAGA, Hungary, China, Iran, north Korea). Oh, and can't forget the Russians also covering up their horrific crimes against humanity that they are perpetrating on Ukraine. Social media is less social than ever before, while corporate influence and bot-driven content occupy more of the space that was supposed to be ours. Formerly vibrant platforms, like what once was Twitter, are now overrun with far right conspirators, fake news and information, and bots (so many bots), leaving little room for genuine human connection, appreciation, creativity, or any other real fucking reason to have a social media app.

And yes, AI. AI has incredible promise—it's undeniable, and it has changed lives for the better. It has provided people with new tools for creativity, transformed industries, and made our day-to-day tasks more efficient and enjoyable. But it comes at a cost, and we must not ignore that cost. AI has become a voracious consumer of energy and resources, diverting vast computational power that could have been used to solve real human issues into a relentless march toward automating more and more facets of our lives, often for profit. It is accelerating inequality, widening the divide between those with access to the technology and those who are left behind. In education, the effects are seismic. Generative AI has thrown a wrench into an already fragile system, rendering traditional models of assessment and learning outdated in an instant. Teachers are struggling, students are confused, and the system is woefully unprepared for the profound changes AI has wrought.

Education, which should be the foundation of any thriving society, is actively failing. Public education in America was already struggling with underfunding, outdated materials, and overworked teachers—but the rise of AI has only compounded these issues. Students have easy access to tools that do the work for them, and the motivation to learn foundational skills like critical thinking or problem-solving is dwindling. The system, designed in an era before the internet, is buckling under the weight of technological change. Teachers are drowning in a sea of AI-generated assignments, unable to distinguish genuine understanding from machine-assisted shortcuts. Moreover, instead of embracing technology to empower educators, school administrations are often burdening teachers with unrealistic expectations and ineffective bureaucratic solutions. The result is an entire generation left ill-prepared for the complexities of the modern world, with few skills and a growing disillusionment with the concept of education itself. We are seeing a catastrophic collapse of faith in the education system, and unless drastic steps are taken, the consequences will echo for generations.

And it's not just education. The arts are under siege as well—fields that once provided a haven for human creativity are now flooded with AI-generated content. Music, visual art, writing—industries that were already precarious are now grappling with a flood of automated work that can be churned out endlessly, devoid of the soul and humanity that makes art truly resonate. Sure, it can mimic styles, create realistic images, and write competent prose, but at what cost? It feels like a hollow echo of what should be the unique expression of human experience. AI is leveraged for good, but let’s not fool ourselves: it is predominantly a tool of those in power, used to reinforce their hold over society. Whether it's surveillance, content moderation, or targeted advertising, the purpose is always the same—to maintain control. The truth is, AI isn’t inherently good or evil. It’s a tool, and like any tool, it reflects the intentions of those who wield it. Right now, those wielding it are driven by profit, by control, by the desire to shape society in their image. We need to take a hard look at how AI is being deployed, at whose interests it serves, and who pays the price. We are at a crossroads. AI could be used to empower, to uplift, to connect—but in the wrong hands, it has become a mechanism for exploitation, disempowerment, and the erosion of human creativity and connection.

At the same time, we see rights rolled back. Many US states are stripping away women’s autonomy over their own bodies, while also moving to criminalize natural medicines like THC. It’s not about protecting life; it’s about control. It’s about making sure that the people in power, the ones who claim to protect "traditional values," have a say in the most intimate and personal decisions of others. It’s about sending us back decades, stripping away bodily autonomy, and ensuring that anything outside their narrow purview of "acceptable" is stomped into the ground. Our public health is an afterthought, sacrificed at the altar of corporate profits. Insurance companies decide who lives and who dies. Pharmaceutical giants charge astronomical prices because they can—because they’ve spent decades ensuring there are no affordable alternatives. Meanwhile, the politicians, bought and paid for, spin their bullshit tales of "affordable healthcare" as they fill their pockets with Big Pharma cash.

And let’s not forget the Right to Repair—the right to fix what you own, to take care of your own property without corporate interference. Since the 1970s, corporations have been slowly eroding this right, wrapping their products in proprietary screws, software locks, and threats of voided warranties. It started with cars, where manufacturers decided they didn’t want people tinkering with their own vehicles. Then it spread to electronics, tractors, appliances—everything. Apple, John Deere, Tesla—they’ve all worked to make sure that you can’t fix your own shit without paying them for the privilege. They’ve lobbied to keep it that way, ensuring they maintain a monopoly on repair services, jacking up prices while creating mountains of electronic waste. We’re not allowed to be self-sufficient anymore; we’re forced into their closed ecosystems, nickel-and-dimed for every little thing until we give up and just buy a new one. The Right to Repair is about freedom—freedom from the corporations that want to own not just our products, but our choices, our capabilities, our very independence. And they’ve done everything they can to take that freedom away, one firmware lock at a time. You can all thank Louis Rossmann for doing his level best as one man to spit in their faces and tell them to go fuck themselves as he fights for the Right to Repair.

The climate crisis is here. Look, if you don't think that humans have caused at least part of this, then I can't help you and your ignorance. We live in a modern world of science and reason. I am religious, and I believe in a power higher than myself. Hell, to really piss off the whole spectrum, I'll add that I believe in an all-loving God, who sent His Son so that we may be spared. If you also believe in God, it is theologically impossible to deny science, because he made it. He lead us to observe the natural universe he has created, and here are his supposed disciples, denying his creation could be so complex. I really don't understand how one could be so fucking arrogant to ignore both God and science. Some Christians act like God wouldn’t allow climate change, or any kind of disaster that isn't in line with their perfect, sheltered, chery picked worldview. It’s the height of hypocrisy and arrogance—to think that your belief somehow insulates you from the natural consequences of humanity’s actions. We have poisoned the air and the water, and now we’re reaping what we’ve sown. The climate crisis is the price of that arrogance. CO2 emissions continue to rise unchecked, corporations keep spewing bullshit promises of "carbon neutrality by 2050" while lobbying to avoid meaningful legislation. The world is literally on fire, and they want us to forget it—distract us with the next shiny tech, the next celebrity scandal, the next numbing dose of mindless entertainment. Solar flares are growing stronger, and we have no plans, no protection, no safety net—just prayers and crossed fingers that a Carrington Event-level catastrophe doesn’t knock us back to the 19th century. The emperor has no clothes, and we all see it, but those in power want us to just shut up and accept it.

Then there’s the economy. A system where the wealth gap yawns wider every day. And I don't mean capitalism, because boy, do I have some news: We no longer live in a classically capitalist society. We live in modern, fucked up, globalized Crony Corporate Capitalism. The 1% are untouchable, hidden behind their gated mansions and private security, while the rest of us are told to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps—never mind the fact that they’ve stolen the boots, the straps, and will charge you for the ground you stand on too. Big Pharma continues its price-gouging practices, letting people die while they dodge responsibility and hide behind PR campaigns. The same companies that created the opioid crisis are rebranding, trying to convince us that they’re the good guys while they profit off our pain. Big Beef and Big Agra crush small ranchers and farmers underfoot, monopolizing the food industry until every grocery store aisle is filled with their overpriced garbage. Railroads barely function, and the airline industry is an absolute joke—constant delays, unsafe conditions, treating passengers like cattle while executives rake in bonuses. And Boeing? It’s a miracle they haven’t completely collapsed yet, given the shitshow they’ve become. Profits over safety, every single time.

And of course, there’s Big Tech. What was once a beacon of innovation and human potential has become a cesspool of surveillance capitalism, hollow promises, and stagnation. The tech giants aren’t here to serve you; they’re here to sell you, to mine every scrap of data they can extract from your life and sell it to the highest bidder. Let's get specific.

Take Microsoft, for example. Windows, once a reliable operating system designed for productivity and creativity, has become an enshittified platform filled with forced ads, bloated "features" that nobody asked for, and constant attempts to corral you into their subscription services. The system updates itself when you don’t want it to, introduces new bugs, and removes features that users relied on—all while pushing their own services, like Microsoft Edge, every chance they get. They’ve stopped building a tool for users and started building a tool for themselves to make more money.

Then there's Spotify. Remember when you could download your own music and own it? Now, you’re stuck paying a monthly subscription to essentially rent music, with no ownership, and the added insult of knowing that Spotify pays artists a pittance. They’ve built a platform on the backs of creators, but the ones truly benefiting are the executives and shareholders. Musicians aren’t getting rich off Spotify streams—the company is. The idea of owning your favorite albums, supporting artists directly, is disappearing, replaced by endless subscription fees and zero permanence.

Google, the company that promised to "don't be evil," has turned their search engine into a junkyard. Remember when Google search was the best tool we had for finding information? Now, it’s a labyrinth of ads, SEO-gamed results, and barely useful AI-generated content. Actual, useful results are buried beneath paid placements and pages designed to game the system. Google's mission isn't to help you find answers anymore; it’s to keep you clicking so they can collect data and ad revenue. It’s gotten so bad that "just Google it" should be replaced with "search somewhere else" if you actually want useful information.

The cloud—a concept sold as the future of convenience and connectivity—has become a nightmare for data privacy and security. Sure, it’s great that you can access your files from anywhere, but at what cost? Data breaches are increasing in size and frequency, and each one seems more catastrophic than the last. Millions of personal records, financial details, healthcare information—all leaked because cloud providers care more about profit margins than robust security. The more centralized our data becomes, the more we become targets, with the fallout affecting us while corporations pay a fine and move on.

And where is the innovation? Big Tech likes to parade around buzzwords and half-baked products, but true innovation has stagnated. We get flashy press releases about the next big thing, but it’s usually just old technology rebranded, or worse, outright fraud. Remember Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos? That wasn’t an outlier—that was a product of the tech industry’s obsession with disruption over substance. We keep seeing scams and vaporware, like the so-called revolutionary Rabbit AI and countless other tech grifts that are more about raising venture capital than delivering anything meaningful.

Adobe, once a company that empowered creators, now owns their souls. Their move to subscription-only services means that you no longer buy Photoshop or Illustrator—you rent them indefinitely. Miss a payment, and you lose access to your own work. You’re locked into an ecosystem where your creativity is held hostage by recurring fees. Adobe doesn’t want to empower you; they want to drain you, a monthly fee at a time, with the promise that they might add features that you probably won’t even use.

And let’s not forget about digital ownership—or the lack thereof. When you buy a game digitally, do you really own it? Not at all. You have a license that can be revoked at any time. If a publisher decides to pull a game from a store or revoke access for some reason, it’s gone. The money you paid means nothing. Physical copies are becoming relics, and with them goes the ability to truly own and enjoy your purchases without the fear that they might be taken away. It’s yet another example of how Big Tech and the digital marketplace are stripping away our rights as consumers while wrapping it all in the guise of convenience.

We live in a time where the cloud is killing privacy, where subscription models trap us into never-ending payments, and where actual innovation is stifled in favor of empty promises and exploitative systems. The tech giants have turned into monopolistic gatekeepers—less about creating value for the user and more about extracting every last dollar, every last data point. We’ve traded the thrill of progress for a system where everything is a service, and you own nothing, not even your own data.

We’re living in a world designed to keep us passive, to keep us quiet, and to keep us paying. It’s time we stopped pretending otherwise. It’s a system built on exploitation, that continues its enshitification, and continues the constant erosion of our rights, all disguised as progress.

I think that there is a great phrase that summarizes what the corporate/political elite and the 1% want to force on us, but to really get the whole picture, I want to tell you the story of how the phrase came to be, because it only increases the irony. In 2016, a Danish politician, Ida Auken, published an essay, originally titled: "Welcome to 2030. I own nothing, have no privacy, and life has never been better." Now, by itself, that already sounds fucked, and it is—don’t let them make you think it isn't, ever. But it gets better. See, the World Economic Forum (WEF) loved it so much that they decided to publish an article and video about it. I can’t really dive into the WEF, because there's just too much there, but suffice it to say it’s the rich and powerful from around the world deciding economic policy that will affect you—all without any actual government regulation or governing body to oversee it. Yes, it is as sinister and scary as it sounds. Because the phrase they came up with was so dystopian, it has stuck around since: 

You will own nothing, and be happy.

I say, FUCK THAT. 

They can shove it right up their elitist assholes and out through the mouth like the bullshit they spew. 

I may not be able to fix any of the above, but I am not let them do this without a fight.

At the bare minimum, I can do something......... Different.

Datapunk..... is different. 

At this point, I cant tell if its a movement, an idea, a political ideology, or nothing more than the app I have set out to build becasue I could. But what I can say is it isn't gonna follow the way the world is going. I cannot change the software industry, the government, society, or anything so large and grandiose. But I can do my damndest to do the right thing.






Dataounk - Take back what is yours, on your own terms!

You should own your data, just like you own, well, yourself. In our digital age, our data is becoming more and more integral to our lives. It has taken to place of all kinds of physical momentos we would keep, or knowledge we might write down. A log of our iteractions with the world in many ways. Your data, even if you are generating it on a platform you don't own, should be yours, because you made it. 

With the advent of modern llms and other ai, we have begun to see the true value of personal data.



I wantt datapunk to be the way we store our modern personal data, and to make it personally useful to each user, and extensible with ai. It will be able to hook into any data stream you could think of and then some, take any kind of bulk data dump, and store it however I want it stored (cloud, local, network, hybrid, etc). It will be your account to consolidate your other accounts, from google, Microsoft, spotify, discord, youtube, twitch, openai, anthropic, facebook, instagram, meta, hugging face, linkedin, x, notion, amazon, you name it. I want all that data to be stored in a postgres databasel, using every extension it can. I want it to have ai built into the backend workflow, that constantly are intaking new data, and ensuring any data that is duplicated unncessarily, old, or incorrect gets removed or archived. I want ai to be built in to the backend that are driving new reports for users on their data, that the average user may not think about or know, because the place it came from wasnt using it that way. I want the Nueromancer pipline to create and train the ai to work on and be specialists in a users data in a specific field/datastream, learning their habits, prefrences, and more, which can still be tweaked and know by the user. I want there to be a central hybrid model, the NueroCortex, to be like Gaia, fromn the Horizon game series. It will oversee everything, and help with being an overseer and the main commicant with the user for settings and managing the other models. I want the NueroCortex to also be able to harnse the power of lager llms than can be on a single devicem such as those from openai and anthropic, to be useful in creating psitive data for the user based on interactions within the datapunk app, and with understand data on the backend and creating reports and summaries. 

The backend will be fast api in python, allowing flexibility and easy creation of a robust api for Haystack and Langchain, the two components of the NueroCortex, to use with the database and frontend. The database will be postres, extended to be performant, and multifacisted (see postgresext.md for all the extensions we want to use, so far...). The frontend will be built in svelt for performane, beauty, and ability to be compiled. It should be very cyberpunk/retrowave themed and styled, though we will add customization options too. It should be reactive and modern with all the fun stuff, without being excesive and flashy. 

I want to build the whole thing in a docker image, with the frontend, backend, and database all seperated to allow the app to have limited functionality if one container were to go down for maintenence or reset. It should also be future proofed to be able to run on kubernetes and servers, incase we can offer a cloud backup as a paid service in the future. Evenntually i want this to be able to run on android and linux, but for now we can start at a dockerimage on a windows desktop. Also, eventually, I want the app to be able to draw its own window, but for now it can be a browser hosted frontend.
