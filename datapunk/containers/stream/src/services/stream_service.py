Stream Service Core Module

This module implements real-time event processing and state management for the
Datapunk platform. It coordinates with the message queue for event distribution
and maintains stream state in cache for performance and reliability.

NOTE: This service is part of the Core Services layer, handling event streams
for real-time data processing and analytics.
