    This store is a critical component for AI/ML operations, handling:
    - Storage and retrieval of model embeddings
    - Similarity search for semantic matching
    - Vector operations for the Cortex Service
    
    Implementation Details:
    - Uses pgvector for efficient vector operations and indexing
    - Supports cosine similarity as default distance metric
    - Integrates with PostgreSQL for ACID compliance
    
    Performance Considerations:
    - Vector dimensions should be consistent within collections
    - Index creation recommended for datasets > 10k vectors
    - Consider batch operations for bulk inserts
