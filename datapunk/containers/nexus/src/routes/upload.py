"""
Nexus Gateway Upload Module

This module handles data ingestion through the Nexus Gateway, specifically for bulk data uploads
from external services. It coordinates with Lake Service for storage and Stream Service for 
event processing, implementing the DataOps routing rules defined in the gateway layer.

NOTE: This module is part of the data sovereignty initiative, allowing users to reclaim 
their data from major platforms starting with Google Takeout.
