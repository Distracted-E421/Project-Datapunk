### Introduction (3 points)

- The goal of this project is to **empower users to reclaim the data that large corporations collect and profit from**, allowing them to gain insights and control over their personal information.
- The reason this project is important is because **it provides transparency, ownership, and control over personal data** that is otherwise collected by tech giants like Google and Microsoft, who often use this data without clear user benefit.
- The beneficiaries of this project are **individual users who want to take control of their personal data**, as well as **privacy-conscious individuals looking for better insights and AI integration without corporate exploitation**.

---

### Features (10 points)

The final product will offer the following features:

#### Data Import and Parsing

- Users will be able to import their personal data from various sources (e.g., Google Takeout, Microsoft, or other platforms) and have it parsed into manageable formats for analysis and insights.

#### Secure Storage and Encryption

- All imported data will be securely stored and encrypted using existing libraries, ensuring user privacy and protection from unauthorized access.

#### Data Visualization Dashboard

- The project will feature interactive visualizations, enabling users to explore their personal data, recognize patterns, and derive meaningful insights in an accessible and user-friendly interface.

#### Data Export and API Integration

- Users will have the ability to export their data or connect the platform with other services through custom APIs, allowing for further analysis or integration with third-party tools.

*If additional features arise during development, they will be integrated following the same security and user-friendly principles.*

### Production Needs (3 points)

Completing this project requires access to certain important resources. These include data, software, hardware, and financial needs, as described below:

#### Data

- The data needed includes user exports from Google, Microsoft, and potentially other tech platforms. These datasets will form the basis for parsing, analysis, and visualization.

#### Software

- The software development tools needed include **Python** for data processing, **Postgres or MongoDB** for data storage, and libraries for **data encryption** and **visualization**. The platform will also use **custom APIs** for integration with external tools.

#### Hardware

- Standard computing hardware should suffice, though **cloud-based infrastructure** could be useful for scalability or real-time data processing, depending on the project’s growth.

#### Funding

- Currently, no substantial financial needs are anticipated. However, if the project requires additional resources (e.g., cloud hosting or specific security tools), a small budget for cloud infrastructure could be justified.

### User Needs (3 points)

- The end users are going to be **privacy-conscious individuals and tech enthusiasts** who are interested in regaining control over their personal data and deriving insights from it.
- To effectively use the product of this work, the end users will need to be trained on how to **import their data, navigate the visualizations, and interpret the insights** the platform provides.
- To help the intended users benefit from this work, we will provide appropriate documentation. Documentation will include **user guides** on how to import data, **tutorials** on navigating visualizations, and **API integration instructions**.

---

### Security and Privacy (3 points)

- This project **does require access to personally identifiable information and private data**, as it processes and visualizes user data from tech giants like Google and Microsoft.
- The project will include appropriate controls to protect this data, including **data encryption** for storage, **secure APIs**, and **user authentication measures** to prevent unauthorized access.

---

### Summary (3 points)

- This project will produce **a platform that empowers users to reclaim and analyze their personal data** from large tech corporations.
- It will benefit **privacy-conscious individuals** by providing them features such as **data parsing, secure storage, data visualization, and API integration**.
- The project **does deal with people’s private data**, but it will include appropriate controls to protect it.
- To complete this project, we will make use of **Python, encryption libraries, data visualization tools, and possibly cloud infrastructure**. At this time, no specific funding is required, though cloud resources may necessitate a small budget if needed for scaling.
