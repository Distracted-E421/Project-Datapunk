1. data_rules.py:
This file manages the rules for determining which database and collection a file should be pushed to. It also includes a logger to track the status of file imports.

Key functions:

log_import(file_name, status): Logs the result of each import (success/failure).
determine_db_and_collection(filename, data): Decides which database and collection to use based on the filename. Current rules look for keywords like "users" or "orders" in filenames.
2. import_manager.py:
This file scans the directory (data_dump/) for files to import, then determines the appropriate database and collection for each, and performs the data insertion.

Key parts:

DB_CONNECTIONS: Maps each database key (e.g., mongo_test1) to its corresponding database connection.
import_data(): Scans the data_dump directory, parses the files, and imports them to the appropriate database and collection. It uses:
parse_file(): A function from the parser.py script to handle the actual parsing of files.
determine_db_and_collection(): To decide the destination database and collection for the parsed data.
3. parser.py:
This script handles parsing different file formats (JSON and CSV).

Key functions:

parse_file(file_path): Automatically detects if a file is JSON or CSV, parses the content, and returns it.
4. dp-test1.py:
This file is a database-specific script that connects to MongoDB and handles data insertion for one particular database.

5. settings.py:
This is your Django settings file, which includes configurations for Redis, MongoDB databases, and general Django settings.

Key configurations:

CACHES: Configures Django to use Redis for caching.
MONGODB_DATABASES: Lists the different MongoDB databases and their connection parameters (e.g., mongo_test1, mongo_prod1, etc.).
Next Steps:
Complete Parsing Logic for JSON/CSV: Ensure that the parser.py can handle all edge cases for JSON and CSV files (such as nested structures in JSON or irregular CSVs).

Expand Rules in data_rules.py: You might want to expand the logic for determine_db_and_collection() to cover more cases, depending on the types of data you'll be importing.

Postgres and Redis Setup: Add connections for Postgres in a similar way to how youâ€™ve set up MongoDB connections in settings.py and the import manager.

Debugging/Logging: Ensure you have sufficient logging for debugging purposes in all scripts, so you can easily track where errors occur during data import.
