Datapunk: Project Plan

Overview:
Datapunk is an open-source tool designed to help users reclaim, organize, and cultivate personal data from platforms like Google Takeout. It consolidates user data into databases such as CouchDB and PostgreSQL with PostGIS for privacy-focused management, avoiding corporate cloud services. The primary goal is to allow users to gain insights from their data through an intuitive dashboard while keeping future AI integration in mind.

1. Data Parsing & Storage: Successfully parse and store one dataset (e.g., location history).
2. Visualization: Build an interactive dashboard with basic visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, time-series graphs).
3. Security: Implement TLS/SSL and containerization using Docker for secure local data handling.

Skills Required

1. Backend Development (Python/Django): Data parsing, database management, API creation.
2. Database Management (CouchDB, PostgreSQL/PostGIS): Efficient data storage and querying.
3. Data Visualization (D3.js, Plotly): Building interactive visuals for user insights.
4. Security: Implement encryption and secure storage.

Criticism Adjustments:
