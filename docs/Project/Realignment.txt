Datapunk: Project Plan

Overview:
Datapunk is an open-source tool designed to help users reclaim, organize, and cultivate personal data from platforms like Google Takeout. It consolidates user data into databases such as CouchDB and PostgreSQL with PostGIS for privacy-focused management, avoiding corporate cloud services. The primary goal is to allow users to gain insights from their data through an intuitive dashboard while keeping future AI integration in mind.
