Hi, everyone.

Just a reminder that your written project launch is due Sunday by 11:59pm.

Remember to address these points in your project proposal:

Clear, engaging title - 2 points

Paragraph description of what the project will achieve - 3 points

Summary of main goals - 3 points

Explanation of the project's value - 3 points

Description of other approaches including citations - 6 points

Comparison of your approach to previous approaches - 3 points

Summary of personnel - 5 points

If you are going to work in a group, please limit your group to no more than 3 students. In rare, exceptional cases, I will approve a group of 4, but it will have to be a very large project for me to approve it. So, please limit your groups to 3 people or fewer. Working alone is fine too.

Please use the "Written Project Launch" link to submit your proposal. Please post only one submission per group, but clearly indicate everyone's name on the title page.

- doing As always, let me know if you have questions.

Hi, everyone.

This is a reminder that your next assignment is the formal project launch document. It is due Sunday, September 22, at 11:59pm. For that assignment, you must describe in detail the project you are going to work on for the rest of the semester. As part of that proposal, you must also announce the members of your team. I know some of you prefer to work alone, but many of you indicated you wanted to work with others on a project because your project required more people with diverse skills. If that is the case, you must take these days now to read each other's resumes and idea posts and try to find people to team up with to form your project group. You can't put that off because then you'll run out of time to complete your project proposal. So, if you haven't been reviewing your classmates' resumes and idea posts, do that this weekend and reach out to people you think you might like to team up with. And, do respect the decision of some who wish to work alone. Not everyone is going to work in a team, and that is totally fine.

Please let me know if you have questions or need help.

Hi, everyone.

I have graded your individual project proposals and left comments. I was really impressed by the quality of your ideas. The most common problem was too much ambition, as some of you described a project that could not be completed in six to eight weeks of development because it was too broad or too complicated. In those cases, I recommended that you narrow your focus significantly to an aspect of your proposed project.

You now have two weeks to read through each other's proposals and resumes and determine what projects you want to pursue for the remainder of the course and with whom. Use this week to become acquainted with each other's projects and skills. If you really like your own idea but need a partner to work with, look at other student's resumes to see who has the skills you need to complete your team. If you are open to work with someone else on their project rather than the one you proposed, seek out those that interest you that need someone with your specific skills to join the team.

You can certainly work on your own on the project you proposed this week if that's what you prefer, provided you are confident you could complete it on your own.

Your final proposal will be due on September 22 at 11:59pm. It will be graded per the rubric in the syllabus, which I've reprinted here:

Clear, engaging title - 2 points

Paragraph description of what the project will achieve - 3 points

Summary of main goals - 3 points

Explanation of the project's value - 3 points

Description of other approaches including citations - 6 points

Comparison of your approach to previous approaches - 3 points

Summary of personnel - 5 points

Will not be able to do this in just a few hours the night it is due. You must get started on it now in order to have a good proposal to turn in on the 22nd.

I will be in AS106A on 9/11 and on 9/16 at 11:50am. If you want to meet with me in person, please be there at 11:50am and we can talk about your proposal. Also, feel free to reach out to me anytime by email or by scheduling an online meeting using the Schedule a Meeting link in Blackboard.

Have a good day.
