Data Analysis & Parsing

1. Data Parsing Methods:

   - **Pre-Built Parsers**:
     - Create **parsers for common data formats** from popular platforms like Google, Microsoft, and Meta. For example, parsing JSON data to extract contacts, events, social interactions, etc.
     - **Example**: A pre-built parser for Google Calendar data that automatically extracts event details (title, location, time, participants) and stores them for further analysis.

   - **Custom Parsing Scripts**:
     - Allow users to **upload or write custom parsing scripts** in a scripting language (e.g., Python) for niche data formats.
     - **Example**: A user uploads a script that extracts custom fields from their financial data in CSV format, categorizing transactions based on custom rules.

   - **Data Cleaning Tools**:
     - Offer **data cleaning features** like handling missing values, data normalization, and removing outliers. This ensures that the data quality is maintained for accurate analysis.
     - **Example**: Automatically flag incomplete records (e.g., contacts missing an email address) and offer options to either remove or fill in missing data.

2. Data Enrichment:

   - **Metadata Augmentation**:
     - Automatically enrich data by adding **metadata**. For instance, enriching location data from calendar events with additional geographical details, like nearby landmarks or weather information at the event time.
     - **Example**: A user’s travel history is enriched by providing additional insights, such as average temperature during each trip, or travel time.

   - **Cross-Source Correlation**:
     - **Correlate data** from different sources to provide richer insights. For example, cross-referencing location data from Google with fitness activity from wearable devices to analyze how travel affects physical activity.
     - **Example**: Integrate Spotify listening history with Google Calendar events to determine what kind of music a user prefers during specific types of activities (e.g., gym sessions, working hours, or commutes).

3. Automated Summarization & Reports:

   - **Data Summarization**:
     - Automatically generate **summaries** of imported data, highlighting key metrics and trends. This helps users get a quick overview without delving into the details.
     - **Example**: Generate a monthly summary of time spent in meetings (from calendar data) and music listened to (from Spotify), highlighting the most common genres and artists.

   - **Automated Reports**:
     - Provide **templated reports** for different types of analyses (e.g., time management, communication frequency, social media engagement). Users can schedule these reports for periodic updates.
     - **Example**: A weekly report that analyzes a user's communication trends across email and social media to highlight their busiest days or changes in response times.

4. Data Visualization Preparation:

   - **Data Structuring for Visualization**:
     - **Prepare data** in a structured way for visualization. This involves transforming raw data into formats suitable for charts, graphs, and heatmaps.
     - **Example**: Normalize the frequency of messages sent across different social platforms so that they can be visualized side-by-side on a timeline chart.

   - **Data Aggregation**:
     - Enable **aggregation functions** like sum, average, min, max, count, etc., to facilitate high-level insights.
     - **Example**: Aggregate financial transaction data to show total spending per category over time, helping users better manage their budget.

5. Data Analysis Techniques:

   - **Trend Analysis**:
     - Identify **trends over time** in user behavior. This might include identifying spikes in social media usage, increased fitness activity, or more frequent travel.
     - **Example**: Analyze trends in Spotify listening behavior, like detecting a seasonal shift in music preference (e.g., upbeat music in summer vs. relaxing music in winter).

   - **Clustering and Segmentation**:
     - Apply **clustering algorithms** to segment data into meaningful groups, helping users understand different patterns.
     - **Example**: Segment communication data to differentiate between work-related and personal conversations based on contact groups or conversation keywords.

   - **Anomaly Detection**:
     - Use anomaly detection techniques to flag unusual behavior or data points, providing insights into deviations from the user's typical patterns.
     - **Example**: Detect an unusually high number of emails sent during a specific period, which might indicate an urgent project or issue.

6. Custom User Queries:

   - **Query Interface**:
     - Allow users to **run custom queries** on their data using a query language (e.g., SQL-like or a simpler, guided query builder).
     - **Example**: A user queries their Spotify data to see how often they listen to a specific artist during workout hours in the last six months.

   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
     - Implement **NLP capabilities** to allow users to ask questions about their data in natural language.
     - **Example**: A user asks, “How much time did I spend on meetings last month?” and receives a detailed summary.
