   - **Custom Parsing Scripts & Future Custom Implementations**:
     - Allow users to **upload or write custom parsing scripts** in a scripting language (e.g., Python) for niche data formats. This enables flexibility in dealing with data that is not covered by pre-built parsers.
     - Custom parsing solutions will also be required for several niche scenarios where pre-built options may not exist:
       - **Financial Data Imports**: Financial records from various banks or budgeting applications often come in unique CSV or JSON formats. Each institution may use different headers or formatting conventions, necessitating custom scripts to normalize and standardize this data for analysis.
       - **Wearable Device Data**: Data from wearable fitness devices such as FitBit or Apple Watch may require custom parsing due to proprietary formats. A custom parser could convert raw activity data into standard metrics such as steps, calories burned, or heart rate trends, and correlate it with other datasets.
       - **Manual File Uploads**: Users may upload manually exported files from niche services that aren't covered by existing parsers, such as smaller social media platforms or proprietary CRM systems. Custom parsing scripts can help identify the structure and extract relevant data fields from such diverse sources.
       - **Email Parsing**: While pre-built parsers may handle some standard email formats, forwarded emails from various services may need custom parsing logic. This will ensure that only relevant information from report-style emails is extracted and imported, discarding unnecessary metadata and formatting.
       - **Cross-Source Data Correlation**: Parsing data to establish correlations between heterogeneous data sources, like matching calendar events with Spotify listening habits or correlating wearable data with travel locations, often requires custom transformation and integration logic.
     - **Example**: A user uploads a script that extracts custom fields from their financial data in CSV format, categorizing transactions based on custom rules.

   - **Data Cleaning Tools & Considerations**:
     - Custom data cleaning tools will be necessary to ensure consistency and usability of the imported data, especially considering the variability of sources.
     - **Key Features of Effective Data Cleaning Tools**:
       - **Schema Standardization**: Tools that recognize different input formats (e.g., different headers for the same field like "Phone" vs. "Phone Number") and align them to a consistent internal schema. This will help to automatically rename headers, standardize field types, and merge similar records.
         - **Example**: Automatically standardize different representations of contact data from Google and Microsoft to align with a unified format.
       - **Field Type Normalization**: Converting data types (e.g., from strings to dates or numbers) to ensure consistency.
         - **Example**: Converting date fields into a standardized ISO 8601 format.
       - **Deduplication and Record Matching**: Tools that identify duplicate entries, using fuzzy matching for cases where data is not identical but represents the same entity.
         - **Example**: Detect duplicate contacts like "John Smith" across Google Contacts and Outlook, suggesting merging them.
       - **Handling Redundant Data**: Implement deduplication logic to automatically detect and merge redundant records from batch imports, such as Google Takeout.
       - **Missing Value Imputation**: Tools that provide mechanisms to either fill in gaps (e.g., using statistical methods) or flag missing data for user review.
         - **Example**: Fill in missing timestamps in location history by estimating from adjacent data points or flagging for manual correction.
       - **Validation and Correction**: Tools that validate data against standard rules (e.g., correct email format, valid ranges for numerical data) and suggest corrections.
         - **Example**: Flag and correct invalid email addresses that are missing characters like "@".
       - **Privacy and Security**:
         - **Sensitive Data Detection**: Identify PII such as email addresses, names, or phone numbers, and provide tools for anonymizing or encrypting this data before storing or processing.
           - **Example**: Replace real user names with generic identifiers like "User001" while maintaining linkage within the dataset.
         - **Token and Authentication Data**: Ensure proper handling and anonymization of OAuth tokens and API keys to avoid unauthorized access.
       - **Anonymization and Redaction**: Offer functions to redact or anonymize sensitive information that users may not want included in their datasets.
         - **Example**: Automatically remove PII from imported datasets based on user preferences before saving data locally.

3. Automated Summarization & Reports:

   - **Data Summarization**:
     - Automatically generate **summaries** of imported data, highlighting key metrics and trends. This helps users get a quick overview without delving into the details.
     - **Implementation Details**:
       - **PostgreSQL Tools**: Use **materialized views** to store precomputed summaries of key metrics, such as total time spent in meetings, average response times, or top music genres played. Materialized views allow summaries to be refreshed periodically or on-demand to ensure users have the most current data without the need to recompute it each time.
       - **Pandas (Python Library)**: Summaries can also be generated using Pandas, which is ideal for working directly with imported data. Scripts can quickly aggregate data to generate summaries like monthly activity overviews or a list of top contacts.
       - **Template Generation**: Utilize a templating tool like **Jinja2** to produce a readable summary report from preprocessed data, ensuring consistent and easy-to-understand output.
       - **Example**: A user views a monthly summary that aggregates the total hours spent in meetings from Google Calendar data, with results stored in a materialized view for efficient retrieval.

   - **Automated Reports**:
     - Provide **templated reports** for different types of analyses (e.g., time management, communication frequency, social media engagement). Users can schedule these reports for periodic updates.
     - **Implementation Details**:
       - **pg_cron for Scheduling**: Use the **pg_cron** extension in PostgreSQL to schedule the periodic extraction and processing of data for reports. For example, weekly or monthly jobs can automatically trigger report generation.
       - **Data Storage**: Store aggregated metrics and trend data in **PostgreSQL** to allow historical comparisons. This storage facilitates easier trend identification over multiple timeframes.
       - **Visualization Tools**: Use **Matplotlib** or **Plotly** to create visual elements for the reports, such as charts or graphs. These visualizations help make the reports more informative and engaging.
       - **PDF or HTML Reports**: Use libraries like **ReportLab** (for PDF) or **WeasyPrint** (for HTML) to generate shareable and professionally formatted reports. These reports can then be emailed to users or made available for download.
       - **Example**: A user receives a weekly report analyzing their communication trends across email and social media, with detailed charts showing busiest periods and average response times, generated by combining PostgreSQL data with Matplotlib visualizations.

4. Data Visualization Preparation:

   - **Data Structuring for Visualization**:
     - **Prepare data** in a structured way for visualization. This involves transforming raw data into formats suitable for charts, graphs, and heatmaps.
     - **Normalization and Cleaning**: Normalize data formats (e.g., consistent date formats like ISO 8601) and remove null values or duplicates using tools like PostgreSQL’s `COALESCE()` and `DISTINCT`.
       - **Example**: Normalize the frequency of messages sent across different social platforms so that they can be visualized side-by-side on a timeline chart.
     - **Data Integration Across Sources**: Use **JOIN** operations in PostgreSQL to bring together data from multiple sources, such as linking Spotify listening records with Google Calendar events to show the type of music users prefer during certain activities.
       - **Example**: Link listening history with calendar events to show preferred music genres during workout times versus study sessions.
     - **Handling Time Series Data**: Partition time series data (e.g., activity levels) using time-based indexing or **window functions** in PostgreSQL. Aggregate data at different granularities as needed for visualization (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly).
       - **Example**: Aggregate activity data by week to visualize trends, or use hourly granularity to visualize changes throughout the day.
     - **Schema Design**: Design a **star schema** or **snowflake schema** in PostgreSQL where a central fact table stores main metrics, and dimension tables store descriptive attributes.
       - **Example**: Use foreign keys to connect a listening history table to a music genres table, enabling easy exploration of how preferences change over time.

   - **Data Aggregation**:
     - Enable **aggregation functions** like sum, average, min, max, count, etc., to facilitate high-level insights.
       - **High-Level Metrics**: Use functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `COUNT()` to derive insights.
         - **Example**: Use `SUM()` to calculate the total duration of music played over a given period, or `AVG()` to determine the average meeting length.
       - **Grouping and Rolling Aggregates**: Use `GROUP BY` and window functions (`AVG() OVER()`) in PostgreSQL to group data and create rolling aggregates.
         - **Example**: Group listening data by genre and aggregate by month to understand changes in genre preferences.

         - **Example**: Pivot activity data to compare “Work Hours Activity” versus “Leisure Hours Activity” side-by-side.
       - **Data Indexing for Faster Retrieval**: Index frequently queried columns like timestamps or user IDs to ensure fast data retrieval for real-time dashboards.
         - **Example**: Index calendar events by `event_date` to quickly filter and retrieve events for specific time frames.
       - **Dimensionality Reduction for Simplified Views**: Filter unnecessary columns or dimensions to reduce complexity.
         - **Example**: Focus on key financial data (e.g., `date`, `amount`, `category`) for a spending trend chart instead of including every detail.
       - **Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Simplify complex aggregation queries by breaking them into manageable components with **CTEs**.
         - **Example**: Create a CTE that calculates monthly spending by category, then use it to build a summary for visualization.
       - **Handling Missing Values and Outliers**: Fill in missing values using imputation techniques (e.g., PostgreSQL’s `COALESCE()`) and identify outliers using standard deviation calculations.
         - **Example**: Flag irregular step count data that might distort trends, or fill in missing timestamps by estimating from adjacent values.
       - **Adjustable Granularity**: Allow aggregation to different granularities for visualization, letting users zoom in (daily views) or zoom out (monthly or yearly views).
         - **Example**: Display daily details of workout activities or overall workout frequency trends over several months.

5. Data Analysis Techniques:
