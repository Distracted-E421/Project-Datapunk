Data Acquisition & Import

1. Data Sources:

   - **Batch Imports**:
     - **Google Takeout and Manual Dumps**: Allow users to manually upload files from services like Google Takeout (JSON, CSV) or other bulk data exports, including photos, browsing history, financial transactions, etc. These dumps are expected to be irregular and will often include redundant data requiring clean-up. Google Takeout provides data in various formats, such as JSON and CSV, which can be parsed to extract information like Google Search history, location history, and saved contacts. This manual batch import will allow users to gather comprehensive datasets about their digital activity for analysis in Datapunk.

   - **Direct API Integrations**:
     - Set up integrations with platforms like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Spotify to allow users to pull data directly, reducing manual efforts.
     - **Google Calendar**: Extract calendar events, including details like event title, location, participants, recurrence, and status (e.g., confirmed, tentative). This data can be used to analyze users' time management and scheduling habits.
     - **Google Contacts**: Access contact information, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and categories/tags. This allows users to see trends in communication and contact management.
     - **Microsoft Outlook**: Extract events from users' Outlook Calendar, including details like event time, location, and participants. Outlook Contacts can also be accessed to gather contact information, allowing users to track communication patterns. Integration with Microsoft Teams can further provide data on users' collaboration and meeting activity.
     - **Spotify**: Pull users' listening history, including recently played tracks, playlists, and favorite songs. This allows users to analyze their music preferences and trends over time, such as their most-played genres or shifts in listening habits.
     - **Meta (Facebook & Instagram)**: Extract user posts, likes, comments, and reactions from Facebook, as well as media posts from Instagram. This data can help users analyze their social media engagement, content preferences, and interactions over time.

   - **Manual File Uploads**:
     - Enable users to upload CSVs, JSON files, or other formats to manually import data from diverse sources. This feature supports importing data that may not be covered by direct integrations, allowing users to add information like financial records or data from niche services.

   - **Email Parsing**:
     - Allow users to forward emails (e.g., from services providing data reports like Spotify Wrapped) for automatic parsing and import. Email parsing can be used to extract structured data from reports, such as music summaries, purchase histories, or activity digests.

   - **Web Scraping**:
     - Provide basic scraping tools to pull data from websites where users interact but can't easily export data. This may include scraping activity data from forums, niche social media platforms, or other websites that lack export features, while ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards.

2. Batch vs. Real-Time Import:

   - **Scheduled Imports**:
     - Offer scheduled imports for real-time data updates from APIs, such as daily or weekly synchronization. For example, users could schedule a daily sync of their Google Calendar and Contacts, allowing Datapunk to provide up-to-date insights into their scheduling habits and communication networks.

   - **On-Demand Imports**:
     - Allow users to manually trigger imports whenever they want to refresh their data. This gives users control over when their data is updated, which can be particularly useful for data sources like Spotify listening history, where users may want immediate insights after a listening session.

   - **Streaming Import**:
     - Support continuous data collection for certain sources (e.g., real-time fitness data from wearable devices). This would allow users to see live insights, such as tracking physical activity throughout the day or monitoring collaboration activity in Microsoft Teams in real-time.

3. OAuth 2.0 Integration:

   - **Google OAuth**:
     - **APIs to Access**: Calendar, Contacts, Gmail, Drive.
     - **Common Scopes**:
       - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`: Read Google Calendar events.
       - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly`: Access Google Contacts.
       - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`: Read files from Google Drive.
     - **Documentation**: [Google OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)

   - **Microsoft OAuth (via Microsoft Graph)**:
     - **APIs to Access**: Outlook (Calendar, Contacts), OneDrive, Teams.
     - **Common Scopes**:
       - `Calendars.Read`: Read users' Outlook Calendar events.
       - `Contacts.Read`: Read users' contacts.
       - `Files.Read`: Read files stored in OneDrive.
     - **Documentation**: [Microsoft Identity Platform OAuth 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)

   - **Spotify OAuth**:
     - **APIs to Access**: Spotify listening history, playlists, top tracks.
     - **Common Scopes**:
       - `user-read-recently-played`: Access users' recently played tracks.
       - `user-library-read`: Access the user's saved songs.
       - `playlist-read-private`: Access users' private playlists.
     - **Documentation**: [Spotify Web API Authentication](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)

   - **Meta (Facebook & Instagram) OAuth**:
     - **APIs to Access**: User profile, posts, reactions, Instagram media.
     - **Common Scopes**:
       - `public_profile`: Access basic profile information.
       - `user_posts`: Access a user's posts.
       - `user_likes`: Read the content a user has liked.

   - **Considerations for Datapunk**:
     - **User Consent Transparency**: Clearly explain what data will be accessed and how it will be used, showing requested permissions to build trust.
     - **Token Storage**: Securely store access and refresh tokens (e.g., encrypted in a database) to ensure long-term access without repeated logins.
     - **Rate Limits**: Each API has rate limits, so it's important to plan around these limits to avoid data disruptions.
     - **Handling OAuth Errors**: Implement fallback mechanisms for token expiry, revoked authorization, or network issues, with user notifications to provide a better experience.

4. Data Import Feedback:

   - **Progress Indicators**:
     - **Purpose**: Provide transparency during the data import process to ensure users understand the status and duration of imports. This feature helps users feel in control and provides a sense of progress.
     - **Example**: When a user uploads their Google Takeout data, a progress indicator would display the percentage completed, estimated time remaining, and different stages of the import (e.g., "Reading files," "Parsing contacts," "Finalizing import"). This gives users clear expectations and keeps them informed.

   - **Error Handling**:
     - **Purpose**: To handle inevitable errors effectively and guide users on how to fix them, reducing frustration.
     - **Example**: If an import fails due to a missing field in a JSON file, an error message like "Error: Missing 'timestamp' field in activity log file" would be displayed. Additionally, users would be provided with a troubleshooting guide suggesting steps such as verifying the file format or re-downloading the data. This helps users quickly identify and resolve issues.

   - **Duplicate Detection**:
     - **Purpose**: Minimize data redundancy and keep imported datasets clean and consistent.
     - **Example**: If users import contacts from multiple sources (e.g., Google Contacts, Microsoft Outlook, and manual CSV uploads), Datapunk will detect multiple entries with the same name and email address. Users can then decide whether to merge duplicates (e.g., combine phone numbers from different accounts) or replace entries, ensuring that data is properly organized and free of unnecessary duplication.

5. API for External Services:

   - **Custom Data Imports**:
     - **Purpose**: Make Datapunk extensible by providing an open API for third-party services to create integrations for their own applications. This makes Datapunk more versatile and adaptable to users' needs.
     - **Example**: If a userâ€™s company has a unique internal CRM tool, developers at that company could use Datapunk's custom API to integrate this CRM. This allows customer interaction data to be pulled directly into Datapunk for analysis, providing the user with a more comprehensive view of interactions across multiple platforms.

   - **Webhook Support**:
     - **Purpose**: Allow real-time data updates, ensuring that users always have current information without needing manual imports.
     - **Example**: If a user uses a habit-tracking app that logs daily activities, they can set up a webhook to push new habit completions directly to Datapunk in real-time. This means the user's data stays up to date without manual intervention, allowing them to view trends and insights immediately after logging new activities.
