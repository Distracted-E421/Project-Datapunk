**Datapunk Drag-and-Drop Interface Implementation Plan**

### **Overview**
The goal is to create a drag-and-drop interface that allows users to easily upload data files in a zipped format. This feature will simplify the data import process, making Datapunk more user-friendly and accessible to non-technical users. The plan will involve setting up both a backend service using FastAPI and a frontend interface using React.

### **Step 1: Backend Setup (FastAPI for File Handling)**

1. **Create a FastAPI Endpoint for File Uploads**
   - **Goal**: Set up an API endpoint to handle file uploads from the frontend. The backend will accept zip files, unzip them, and store the contents in a specified folder for further parsing.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Define an endpoint `/upload-data/` using FastAPI that accepts `POST` requests with file uploads.
     - Save the uploaded zip file temporarily, extract the contents, and remove the temporary file.
     - Trigger the appropriate parsing function after extraction.
   - **Example Code**:
     ```python
     from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
     import shutil
     import zipfile
     import os

     app = FastAPI()

     @app.post("/upload-data/")
     async def upload_data(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
         data_dir = "data/"
         temp_file_path = os.path.join(data_dir, "temp.zip")

         # Save the uploaded file temporarily
         with open(temp_file_path, "wb") as buffer:
             shutil.copyfileobj(file.file, buffer)

         # Extract the zip file
         with zipfile.ZipFile(temp_file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
             zip_ref.extractall(data_dir)

         # Remove the temporary zip file
         os.remove(temp_file_path)

         # Trigger the data parsing logic here
         # load_and_parse_data() or another function to parse the new files

         return {"status": "File uploaded and extracted successfully."}
     ```

2. **Dockerize FastAPI**
   - **Update Dockerfile**: Ensure the FastAPI dependencies are included and expose the necessary port (e.g., `8000`).
   - **Update docker-compose.yml**: Add the backend service to the `docker-compose.yml` file and expose the port to allow communication with the frontend.

### **Step 2: Frontend Setup (React for Drag-and-Drop Interface)**

1. **Initialize a React Project**
   - **Goal**: Create a new React project to serve as the user-facing part of the drag-and-drop data upload feature.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Use `create-react-app` to bootstrap the frontend.
     - Install `react-dropzone` to facilitate the drag-and-drop interaction.

   **Command to Bootstrap React Project**:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app datapunk-frontend
   npm install react-dropzone
   ```

2. **Create Drag-and-Drop Component**
   - **Goal**: Develop a React component that allows users to drag and drop their data files.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Use the `react-dropzone` library to create a drop area where users can drag and drop their zip files.
     - Handle the uploaded file and send it to the FastAPI endpoint using a `POST` request.
   - **Example Code**:
     ```jsx
     import React from 'react';
     import { useDropzone } from 'react-dropzone';

     const FileUpload = () => {
       const onDrop = (acceptedFiles) => {
         const formData = new FormData();
         formData.append('file', acceptedFiles[0]);

         fetch('http://localhost:8000/upload-data/', {
           method: 'POST',
           body: formData,
         })
           .then((response) => response.json())
           .then((data) => {
             console.log(data);
             alert('File uploaded successfully!');
           })
           .catch((error) => {
             console.error('Error:', error);
             alert('Failed to upload file.');
           });
       };

       const { getRootProps, getInputProps } = useDropzone({ onDrop });

       return (
         <div {...getRootProps()} className="dropzone">
           <input {...getInputProps()} />
           <p>Drag 'n' drop some files here, or click to select files</p>
         </div>
       );
     };

     export default FileUpload;
     ```

3. **Add Styles for the Drag-and-Drop Component**
   - **Goal**: Make the drag-and-drop area visually appealing and easy to understand for users.
   - **Tasks**: Use CSS to style the drop area, indicating to users where they should drop their files.

4. **Run the Frontend**
   - **Command to Start React**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### **Step 3: Integration of Frontend and Backend**

1. **Enable CORS in FastAPI**
   - **Goal**: Allow the React frontend to communicate with the FastAPI backend without any cross-origin request issues.
   - **Tasks**: Add CORS middleware to the FastAPI app.
   - **Example Code**:
     ```python
     from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

     app.add_middleware(
         CORSMiddleware,
         allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],  # React dev server
         allow_credentials=True,
         allow_methods=["*"],
         allow_headers=["*"],
     )
     ```

2. **Docker Configuration**
   - **Update Docker Compose**: Update `docker-compose.yml` to include both the backend and frontend services.
   - **Ports**: Expose ports such as `8000` for FastAPI and `3000` for React to ensure they can communicate effectively.

### **Summary of Next Steps**

1. **Backend**: Complete the FastAPI upload endpoint and ensure itâ€™s running.
2. **Frontend**: Set up React, create the drag-and-drop component, and test uploading files.
3. **Integration**: Enable communication between frontend and backend using CORS and Docker.
