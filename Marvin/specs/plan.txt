1. Core API and Authentication:
Core Authentication and Setup: Keep the current spec you posted as-is since it represents the core setup, which includes authentication and basic test methods (like /api/test and /api/me).
API Token and Usage Information: Keep the details from the MarvinAPI-Tokens.txt file about tokens and setup instructions, usage limits, and authentication as a separate section. This would include the tokens, rate limits, and general security concerns. Keep it within a separate section, as it was stated in MarvinOverview.txt, for ease of management​​.

2. Task Management:
Task Operations: Create a new section dedicated to the API endpoints for task management (/api/addTask, /api/markDone, /api/getTasks), which would involve endpoints related to tasks, their creation, completion, deletion, and any parameters that involve scheduling or completion.
Recurring Tasks: Group the recurring tasks separately based on their structure and behavior from the MarvinRecurrence file. Recurrence-specific task structures can reside here, such as the handling of echo tasks, weekly review tasks, or any recurring project-specific logic​​.

3. Project Management:
Project Operations: A section for projects that includes endpoints like /api/addProject, /api/getProjects, and /api/children, for retrieving the children of a project. Include specifics on managing categories, project hierarchies, and completion states​.

4. Database and Direct Access:
CouchDB API Integration: Put all CouchDB-related operations in their own section to deal with operations like querying, updating, or deleting documents directly from the database. This includes the entire document structure for different entities (e.g., Tasks, Projects, Labels)​​​.
Conflict Management: Add documentation related to conflict resolution in PouchDB/CouchDB under a separate conflict management section, based on your CouchDB API data​.

5. Webhooks and Event Handling:
Webhooks: A section dedicated to webhooks configuration and events, including setting them up and handling them for different types of Marvin actions (tasks, projects, timers). This would involve endpoints for creating webhooks and event-based triggers like /api/webhook, /api/timerDone, /api/addTimer, etc.​.

6. Habit Tracking and Gamification:
Habits: Separate API methods related to managing habits (/api/updateHabit, /api/getHabits). You can use this to organize how habits are created, tracked, updated, and managed​.
Gamification: Reward system operations like /api/claimRewardPoints, /api/spendRewardPoints, and other gamification tasks should be grouped into a "Gamification" section​.

7. Miscellaneous:
Other Modules: Any miscellaneous Marvin API modules like managing reminders (/api/reminders), goal tracking (/api/goals), and time tracking (/api/track) can be grouped in a separate section​​.
